**Solution:**

The following profit and loss function for a Chartist Agent trading on two markets simultaneously is based on the research papers "Multi-Asset Agent-Based Model of a Financial Market" by L. T. F. Wang and A. Kirman (2003) and "An Agent-Based Model of the Stock Market: The Role of Interactions, Noise Traders, and Fundamentalists" by T. Lux (1995).

# Profit and Loss Function

Let $P_{1t}$ and $P_{2t}$ denote the prices of assets 1 and 2 at time $t$ respectively, and let $Q_{1t}$ and $Q_{2t}$ denote the number of assets 1 and 2 held by the Chartist Agent at time $t$ respectively.

The profit and loss (PnL) of the agent at time $t$ is given by the following equation:

$$
PnL_t = (P_{1t+1}Q_{1t} + P_{2t+1}Q_{2t}) - (P_{1t}Q_{1t} + P_{2t}Q_{2t})
$$

In other words, the PnL of the agent at time $t$ is the difference between the total value of the two assets held by the agent at time $t$+1 and the total value of the two assets held by the agent at time $t$.
