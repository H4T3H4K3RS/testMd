## **Profit and Loss Function**

The Profit and Loss Function for the Dragon Rider Agent is given by

$$P\&L = \sum_{t=1}^{T} (p_{t} - p_{t-1}) * q_t$$

where $p_{t}$ is the price of the stock at time $t$, $p_{t-1}$ is the price of the stock at the previous time $t-1$ and $q_t$ is the quantity of the stock held by the DRA at time $t$.

The profit is calculated as the difference between the current price of the stock and the price of the stock at the previous time period, multiplied by the quantity of the stock held by the DRA. If the profit is positive, the DRA makes a profit; if the profit is negative, the DRA incurs a loss.
