Market maker agents are used in agent-based models of stock markets to simulate the trading of assets. This paper presents a profit and loss (P&L) function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously.

## **Background**

The concept of a market maker agent is based on the idea of a market maker in a traditional stock exchange. A market maker is a financial institution that stands ready to buy and sell assets such as stocks or bonds, usually at a slightly lower or higher price than the current market price. By providing liquidity to the market, market makers facilitate trade and reduce volatility.

## **Objective**

The objective of this paper is to design a profit and loss (P&L) function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously.

## **P&L Function for Market Maker Agent**

Our proposed P&L function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously is as follows:

$$P&L = (1 - \alpha) \times S_1 + \alpha \times S_2 - (1 - \alpha) \times B_1 - \alpha \times B_2$$

where:

- $S_1$ and $S_2$ are the sale prices of the two markets
- $B_1$ and $B_2$ are the purchase prices of the two markets
- $\alpha$ is the fraction of the funds allocated to the second market

## **Conclusion**

This paper presented a profit and loss (P&L) function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously. The proposed P&L function is a simple and intuitive way to evaluate the profitability of a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously.
