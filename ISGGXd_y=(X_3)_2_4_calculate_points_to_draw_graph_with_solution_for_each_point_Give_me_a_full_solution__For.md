To draw the graph of $(X-3)^2-4$, we need to calculate points on the graph. In order to do this, we will substitute different values of $X$ in the equation and calculate their corresponding values of $Y$. The points thus calculated can then be used to draw the graph.

Let us calculate the points $(X,Y)$ for the equation $(X-3)^2-4$

| X | Y |
|---|---|
| 0 | -7 |
| 1 | -6 |
| 2 | -3 |
| 3 | 0 |
| 4 | 3 |
| 5 | 6 |

These points can be plotted on the graph and connected to plot the graph of $(X-3)^2-4$. The graph is a parabola, which is symmetrical about the $Y$ axis.
