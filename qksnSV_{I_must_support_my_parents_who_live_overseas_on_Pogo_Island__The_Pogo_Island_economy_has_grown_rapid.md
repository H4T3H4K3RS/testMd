**1) Identify three behavioral finance concepts illustrated in Pierceâ€™s comments and describe each of the three concepts.**

a) Status Quo Bias: Pierce is exhibiting status quo bias, as he is reluctant to change his portfolio's long-term asset allocation when buying Pogo Island bonds. He is more likely to continue with the same portfolio, even though it is less optimal for his current situation. 

b) Loss Aversion: Pierce is displaying loss aversion, as he does not want to sell his High Yield Bond Fund, even though it has declined 5% in value year to date. He believes that there is a small probability that the fund may recover quickly, and is therefore not willing to accept the losses. 

c) Mental Accounting: Pierce is exhibiting mental accounting, as he has decided to sell his Core Bond Fund that has appreciated 5% this year, in order to raise cash to buy the Pogo Island bonds. He is willing to take the risk of the potential loss of this year's gains, as he believes that it is a safer option than selling the High Yield Bond Fund. 

**2) Discuss how an investor practicing standard or traditional finance would challenge each of the three concepts.**

a) Status Quo Bias: An investor practicing standard finance would challenge Pierce's status quo bias by stating that the best portfolio for his current situation may not be the same as the one he has been using for many years. They would explain that it is important to re-evaluate the portfolio regularly and make changes when necessary, so that it is best suited for his current needs.

b) Loss Aversion: An investor practicing traditional finance would challenge Pierce's loss aversion by emphasizing that it is important to consider the long-term potential of an investment, rather than focusing solely on the short-term losses. They would explain that it is possible for an investment to quickly recover and even exceed the original value, if held for a long enough time.

c) Mental Accounting: An investor practicing traditional finance would challenge Pierce's mental accounting by stating that it is important to consider the overall portfolio performance, rather than focusing on individual investments. They would explain that it is possible for an investment to quickly recover and even exceed the original value, if held for a long enough time. They would also emphasize the importance of diversifying investments, as this can help to reduce risk and increase returns.
