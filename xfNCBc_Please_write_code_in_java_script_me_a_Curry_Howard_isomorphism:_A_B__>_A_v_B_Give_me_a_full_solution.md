The Curry-Howard isomorphism is a correspondence between logical systems and mathematical structures. According to this isomorphism, the logical connective "and" is equivalent to the mathematical operator "multiplication", and the logical connective "or" is equivalent to the mathematical operator "addition". Thus, the statement "A & B $\rightarrow$ A v B" can be expressed mathematically as:

\begin{equation}
A \times B \rightarrow A + B
\end{equation}

This equation can be solved by factoring the left-hand side of the equation:

\begin{equation}
A \times B \rightarrow (A + B)(A + B)
\end{equation}

Since the right-hand side of the equation is the same as the left-hand side, the equation is proven to be true.

## **Conclusion**

It can be concluded that the Curry-Howard isomorphism holds for the statement "A & B $\rightarrow$ A v B". This isomorphism states that the logical connective "and" is equivalent to the mathematical operator "multiplication" and the logical connective "or" is equivalent to the mathematical operator "addition".
