# Introduction

The construction of an object is a fundamental feature of the C++ programming language. Construction defines how an object is created and initialized, and is a critical feature of the language. This tutorial will explain the various forms of construction available in C++ and how they interact with the language's features.

# Copy Construction

Copy construction is the process of constructing an object based on an existing object. It is similar to assignment, except that the existing object is used to initialize the new object. In C++, this is done by invoking the copy constructor. The syntax for the copy constructor is:

`ClassName(const ClassName& other)`

where `ClassName` is the name of the class, and `other` is a reference to the existing object that is being used to initialize the new object. The copy constructor will create a copy of the existing object and initialize the new object with the same values.

# Move Construction

Move construction is similar to copy construction, except that it does not create a copy of the existing object. Instead, it moves the existing object's resources into the new object. In C++, this is done by invoking the move constructor. The syntax for the move constructor is:

`ClassName(ClassName&& other)`

where `ClassName` is the name of the class, and `other` is an rvalue reference to the existing object that is being used to initialize the new object. The move constructor will move the existing object's resources into the new object.

# Default Construction

Default construction is the process of constructing an object with default values. In C++, this is done by invoking the default constructor. The syntax for the default constructor is:

`ClassName()`

where `ClassName` is the name of the class. The default constructor will create an object and initialize it with default values.

# Summary

In summary, construction in C++ is an important feature of the language. It defines how an object is created and initialized. The various forms of construction available in C++ are copy construction, move construction, and default construction. Copy construction creates a copy of an existing object and initializes the new object with the same values. Move construction moves the existing object's resources into the new object. Default construction creates an object and initializes it with default values.
