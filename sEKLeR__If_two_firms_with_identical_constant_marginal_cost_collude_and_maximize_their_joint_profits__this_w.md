**Answer:**

This statement is **true**. 

When two firms with identical constant marginal cost collude and maximize their joint profits, the resulting allocation is not socially desirable because it does not take into account the welfare of consumers. 

The optimal output that maximizes the profits of the two firms is given by the Cournot-Nash equilibrium, which is the solution to the following system of equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_1 & = MC_1 + \alpha Q_2\\
P_2 & = MC_2 + \alpha Q_1
\end{aligned}
$$

where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the prices of the two firms, $MC_1$ and $MC_2$ are their marginal costs, and $\alpha$ is the degree of product differentiation.

The prices at the Cournot-Nash equilibrium will be higher than the marginal cost of production, which means that the firms will be able to extract economic rents from the consumers. This is not socially desirable, as the welfare of the consumers is not taken into consideration in the solution.
