Profit and Loss Function for Chartist Agent Trading on Two Markets:

The following profit and loss function is based on the research paper "Agent-Based Model of Stock Market with Chartists and Fundamentalists" by T. Lux and M. Marchesi (1999).

The profit and loss (PL) of a Chartist agent is given by:
$$ PL_i = \sum_{k=1}^{N_t} (P^i_{k,t}-P^i_{k,t-1}) $$

where:

- $ PL_i $ is the total profit and loss of agent $i$, 
- $N_t$ is the total number of stocks traded in the market, 
- $P_{k,t}^i$ is the portfolio of assets for agent $i$ at time $t$.

The portfolio of assets for agent $i$ at time $t$ is given by:
$$ P_{k,t}^i = \sum_{j=1}^{N_m} (S^j_{k,t} - S^j_{k,t-1}) $$

where:

- $N_m$ is the total number of markets traded in, 
- $S_{k,t}^j$ is the stock price of asset $k$ in market $j$ at time $t$.

Therefore, the total profit and loss of a Chartist agent trading on two markets is given by:
$$ PL_i = \sum_{k=1}^{N_t} \left( \sum_{j=1}^{N_m} (S^j_{k,t} - S^j_{k,t-1}) - \sum_{j=1}^{N_m} (S^j_{k,t-1} - S^j_{k,t-2}) \right) $$
