**Nash Equilibrium**

The Nash Equilibrium for this game is (3,3), (2,0), (0,2), and (1,1). 

This can be seen in the following table of data: 

| | Player 1 | Player 2 |
|---|---|---|
| **(3,3)** | 3 | 3 |
| **(2,0)** | 2 | 0 |
| **(0,2)** | 0 | 2 |
| **(1,1)** | 1 | 1 |

In order to be a Nash Equilibrium, a strategy must be a best response to the strategies of the other players. For example, in this game, player 1's strategy of (3,3) is a best response to player 2's strategy of (3,3) since it yields the highest payoff for player 1. Similarly, player 2's strategy of (3,3) is a best response to player 1's strategy of (3,3) since it yields the highest payoff for player 2. 

Therefore, (3,3) is a Nash Equilibrium in this game. 

Similarly, player 1's strategy of (2,0) is a best response to player 2's strategy of (2,0) since it yields the highest payoff for player 1, and player 2's strategy of (2,0) is a best response to player 1's strategy of (2,0) since it yields the highest payoff for player 2. Therefore, (2,0) is a Nash Equilibrium in this game. 

Likewise, player 1's strategy of (0,2) is a best response to player 2's strategy of (0,2) since it yields the highest payoff for player 1, and player 2's strategy of (0,2) is a best response to player 1's strategy of (0,2) since it yields the highest payoff for player 2. Therefore, (0,2) is a Nash Equilibrium in this game. 

Finally, player 1's strategy of (1,1) is a best response to player 2's strategy of (1,1) since it yields the highest payoff for player 1, and player 2's strategy of (1,1) is a best response to player 1's strategy of (1,1) since it yields the highest payoff for player 2. Therefore, (1,1) is a Nash Equilibrium in this game. 

Therefore, all of the strategies in this game (3,3), (2,0), (0,2), and (1,1) are Nash Equilibria.
