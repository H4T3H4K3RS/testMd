## (1) World Market for Soybeans

The First Theorem of Welfare Economics states that, under certain conditions, a competitive market will reach a Pareto Optimal allocation of resources without external intervention. Whether or not this theorem holds in the world market for soybeans depends on whether the conditions of the theorem are met.

The conditions that must be met for the First Theorem of Welfare Economics to hold include:

1. Perfect competition: All firms in the market are price takers and cannot affect the market price.

2. Perfect information: Buyers and sellers have perfect information about the prices and characteristics of all goods in the market.

3. Perfect mobility of resources: Resources can move freely from one firm or sector to another.

4. Homogeneous products: All products in the market are identical.

5. Constant returns to scale: Increases in inputs will lead to a proportional increase in outputs.

Given the characteristics of the world market for soybeans, it is likely that the First Theorem of Welfare Economics holds in this market. The world market for soybeans contains a large number of firms and the market is open to international trade. This means that there are many buyers and sellers in the market, making it highly competitive. The soybeans produced in the market are also largely homogeneous, meaning that there is no differentiation among products. Additionally, the market for soybeans is characterized by constant returns to scale, meaning that increases in inputs will lead to a proportional increase in outputs. Finally, buyers and sellers in the market have access to perfect information about prices and characteristics of all goods in the market.

Therefore, it is likely that the First Theorem of Welfare Economics holds in the world market for soybeans.

## (2) World Market for Tablets

The First Theorem of Welfare Economics states that, under certain conditions, a competitive market will reach a Pareto Optimal allocation of resources without external intervention. Whether or not this theorem holds in the world market for tablets depends on whether the conditions of the theorem are met.

The conditions that must be met for the First Theorem of Welfare Economics to hold include:

1. Perfect competition: All firms in the market are price takers and cannot affect the market price.

2. Perfect information: Buyers and sellers have perfect information about the prices and characteristics of all goods in the market.

3. Perfect mobility of resources: Resources can move freely from one firm or sector to another.

4. Homogeneous products: All products in the market are identical.

5. Constant returns to scale: Increases in inputs will lead to a proportional increase in outputs.

Given the characteristics of the world market for tablets, it is unlikely that the First Theorem of Welfare Economics holds in this market. The world market for tablets contains a few large firms which have the ability to affect the market price. The tablets produced in the market are also not homogeneous, as there are a variety of different products available with different features and prices. Additionally, the market for tablets is characterized by increasing returns to scale, meaning that increases in inputs will lead to an even larger increase in outputs. Finally, buyers and sellers in the market may not have perfect information about prices and characteristics of all goods in the market.

Therefore, it is unlikely that the First Theorem of Welfare Economics holds in the world market for tablets.
