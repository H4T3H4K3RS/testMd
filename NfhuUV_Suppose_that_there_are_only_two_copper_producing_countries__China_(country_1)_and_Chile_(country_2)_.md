**(a) Solution:**
#### Residual Demands: 
The residual demand of each country is given by the difference between the inverse demand function and the total cost of production. Thus, the residual demand for Country 1 is given by

$R_1 = P(Q) - TC(y_1) = 30 - y_1 - 6y_1 = 24 - 7y_1$

Similarly, the residual demand for Country 2 is given by

$R_2 = P(Q) - TC(y_2) = 30 - y_2 - 6y_2 = 24 - 7y_2$

#### Marginal Revenues: 
The marginal revenue of each country is given by the derivative of the residual demand with respect to the respective output level. Thus, the marginal revenue of Country 1 is given by

$MR_1 = \frac{dR_1}{dy_1} = -7$

and the marginal revenue of Country 2 is given by

$MR_2 = \frac{dR_2}{dy_2} = -7$

#### Reaction Functions and Graph: 
The reaction functions of each country are given by setting the marginal revenue equal to zero. Thus, the reaction function of Country 1 is given by

$MR_1 = 0 \implies y_1 = \frac{24}{7}$

Similarly, the reaction function of Country 2 is given by

$MR_2 = 0 \implies y_2 = \frac{24}{7}$

The reaction curves for both countries are thus given by the lines $y_1 = \frac{24}{7}$ and $y_2 = \frac{24}{7}$. These curves are shown in the graph below.
