### Profit and Loss Function for Dragon Rider Agent

The Dragon Rider Agent, proposed by [1], is an agent-based model of the stock market that uses a reinforcement learning framework to maximize profits. The Dragon Rider Agent is based on the idea of dynamic trading, which is the process of trading based on the changing market environment. The goal of this agent is to maximize profits by making decisions in the stock market that maximize the expected reward.

The profit and loss function for the Dragon Rider Agent is a function of the reward received for each action taken, as well as the cost of taking each action. The reward for each action is determined by the expected value of the stock at the end of the trading period, while the cost of taking each action is determined by the transaction costs associated with each action.

The profit and loss function of the Dragon Rider Agent can be expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
P\&L = \sum_{t=1}^{T} (r_t - c_t)
\end{equation}

where $T$ is the number of trading periods, $r_t$ is the expected reward from the action taken in the $t$th trading period, and $c_t$ is the cost associated with taking the action in the $t$th trading period.
