# **Template Method Design Pattern**

The Template Method Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern which defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's overall structure.

## **Overview**

The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern which allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's overall structure. It defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. The Template Method pattern is used when you want to define the structure of an algorithm and leave some steps to be implemented by subclasses.

## **Pros**

1. **Reusability**: The Template Method pattern allows for code reuse since it provides a template for a particular algorithm that can be reused in multiple situations.
2. **Flexibility**: The Template Method pattern allows for flexibility since it allows subclasses to override certain steps in the algorithm.
3. **Extensibility**: The Template Method pattern is extensible since it allows for new implementations of the algorithm to be written without changing the overall structure.

## **Cons**

1. **Complexity**: The Template Method pattern can be complex since it requires a lot of code to be written in order to implement the pattern correctly.
2. **Debugging**: The Template Method pattern can be difficult to debug since it requires a lot of code to be written in order to implement the pattern correctly.
3. **Inconsistency**: The Template Method pattern can lead to inconsistencies in the implementation of the algorithm if not implemented correctly.

## **Solution in Java**

The following code shows an example implementation of the Template Method pattern in Java.

```java
public abstract class AbstractClass {
  public void templateMethod() {
    // Step 1
    stepOne();
    // Step 2
    stepTwo();
    // Step 3
    stepThree();
    // Step 4
    stepFour();
  }
 
  // These methods must be implemented by subclasses
  protected abstract void stepOne();
  protected abstract void stepTwo();
  protected abstract void stepThree();
  protected abstract void stepFour();
} 
```

The `AbstractClass` class defines an abstract template of the algorithm which is composed of four steps. These steps are implemented as abstract methods that must be overridden by subclasses in order to provide a concrete implementation of the algorithm. 

The `templateMethod()` method is the template of the algorithm and it calls the four abstract methods which must be implemented by the subclasses. 

The subclasses must implement all four steps of the algorithm in order to provide a valid implementation.
