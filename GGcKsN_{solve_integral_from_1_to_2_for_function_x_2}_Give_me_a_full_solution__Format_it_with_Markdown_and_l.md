# **Solution to Integral of $x^2$ from 1 to 2**

## **Step 1: Set up the integral**

We set up the integral as follows:

$$\int_1^2 x^2 dx$$

## **Step 2: Calculate the integral**

We need to calculate the integral. To do this, we will use the power rule for integration, which states that:

$$\int x^n dx=\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}+C$$

where $C$ is an arbitrary constant. 

Substituting $n$ with $2$, we get:

$$\int_1^2 x^2 dx =\frac{x^3}{3}+C$$

We can now evaluate the integral by plugging in the limits of integration, $1$ and $2$.

$$\int_1^2 x^2 dx =\frac{2^3}{3}-\frac{1^3}{3} =\frac{7}{3}$$

## **Step 3: Simplify the answer**

The final answer is:

$$\int_1^2 x^2 dx =\frac{7}{3}$$
