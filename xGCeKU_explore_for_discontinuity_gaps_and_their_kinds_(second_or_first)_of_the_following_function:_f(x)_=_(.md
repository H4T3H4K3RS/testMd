**Solution:**

The function $f(x)$ can be written as:

$$f(x) = \frac{2|x-1|}{x^2-x^4}$$

To determine the discontinuity gaps and their kinds, we must first consider the domain of the function. In this case, the domain of the function is $\mathbb{R} \backslash \{x=0, x=1, x=-1\}$.

Now, we will consider each of the points $x=0, x=1, x=-1$ in the domain of the function one by one.

### Case 1: $x=0$

At $x=0$, the denominator $x^2-x^4 = 0$ and thus the function is undefined at this point. Therefore, $x=0$ is a discontinuity gap of the function $f(x)$ and it is of the first kind.

### Case 2: $x=1$

At $x=1$, the numerator $2|x-1| = 0$ and thus the function is undefined at this point. Therefore, $x=1$ is a discontinuity gap of the function $f(x)$ and it is of the first kind.

### Case 3: $x=-1$

At $x=-1$, the numerator $2|x-1| = 4$ and thus the function is defined at this point. Therefore, $x=-1$ is not a discontinuity gap of the function $f(x)$.

**Conclusion**

Therefore, the discontinuity gaps of the function $f(x)$ are $x=0$ and $x=1$ and they are of the first kind.
