**Solution**

**Residual Demands:**

The residual demand of country 1 is given by:

$$R_1 = P(y_1 + y_2) - P(y_2) = 30 - (y_1 + y_2) - (30 - y_2) = y_1$$

Similarly, the residual demand of country 2 is given by:

$$R_2 = P(y_1 + y_2) - P(y_1) = 30 - (y_1 + y_2) - (30 - y_1) = y_2$$

**Marginal Revenues:**

The marginal revenue of country 1 is given by:

$$MR_1 = \frac{\partial R_1}{\partial y_1} = \frac{\partial (y_1)}{\partial y_1} = 1$$

Similarly, the marginal revenue of country 2 is given by:

$$MR_2 = \frac{\partial R_2}{\partial y_2} = \frac{\partial (y_2)}{\partial y_2} = 1$$

**Reaction Functions:**

The reaction function of country 1 is given by:

$$y_1 = f_1(y_2) = 6 - y_2$$

Similarly, the reaction function of country 2 is given by:

$$y_2 = f_2(y_1) = 6 - y_1$$

**Graph:**

The reaction curves for both countries are shown in the following graph:
