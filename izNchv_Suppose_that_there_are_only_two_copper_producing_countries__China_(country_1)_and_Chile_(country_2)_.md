## (a) 
The residual demand of each country is the difference between the market demand and the other country's output. 

For country 1, the residual demand is given by: 
$$R_{1}=P(y_{1}+y_{2})-y_{2}$$
$$R_{1}=30-y_{1}-y_{2}-y_{2}=30-y_{1}-2y_{2}$$

For country 2, the residual demand is given by: 
$$R_{2}=P(y_{1}+y_{2})-y_{1}$$
$$R_{2}=30-y_{1}-y_{2}-y_{1}=30-2y_{1}-y_{2}$$

The marginal revenue of each country is the derivative of the residual demand. 

For country 1, the marginal revenue is given by: 
$$MR_{1}=\frac{dR_{1}}{dy_{1}}=-1$$

For country 2, the marginal revenue is given by: 
$$MR_{2}=\frac{dR_{2}}{dy_{2}}=-1$$

The reaction function of each country is the inverse of the marginal revenue. 

For country 1, the reaction function is given by: 
$$y_{1}=\frac{1}{MR_{1}}=-1$$

For country 2, the reaction function is given by: 
$$y_{2}=\frac{1}{MR_{2}}=-1$$

The reaction curves of both countries are given by:

## (b)
The profit-maximizing output levels of both countries are given by: 

For country 1, the profit-maximizing output level is given by: 
$$\frac{d}{dy_{1}}(P(y_{1}+y_{2})-TC(y_{1}))=0$$
$$\frac{d}{dy_{1}}(30-y_{1}-y_{2}-6y_{1})=0$$
$$-1-6=0$$
$$y_{1}^*=5$$

For country 2, the profit-maximizing output level is given by: 
$$\frac{d}{dy_{2}}(P(y_{1}+y_{2})-TC(y_{2}))=0$$
$$\frac{d}{dy_{2}}(30-y_{1}-y_{2}-6y_{2})=0$$
$$-1-6=0$$
$$y_{2}^*=5$$

The market output is given by: 
$$Y^*=y_{1}^*+y_{2}^*=5+5=10$$

The market price is given by: 
$$P^*=P(Y^*)=30-Y^*=30-10=20$$

This equilibrium result is called the Cournot equilibrium.

This market outcome does not result in a market failure since the market price is equal to the marginal cost of production. 

## (c)
The joint marginal revenue of the collusive agreement is given by: 
$$MR_{joint}=\frac{d}{dY}(P(Y)-TC(Y))=\frac{d}{dY}(30-Y-6Y)=24$$

The joint output level of the collusive agreement is given by: 
$$Y_{joint}=\frac{1}{MR_{joint}}=\frac{1}{24}=\frac{5}{6}$$

The market price of the collusive agreement is given by: 
$$P_{joint}=P(Y_{joint})=30-Y_{joint}=30-\frac{5}{6}=25$$

Under the assumption that each member of the agreement produces exactly one half of the total output, the profit of each country is given by: 

For country 1, the profit is given by: 
$$\pi_{1}=(P_{joint}-TC(y_{1}))\times y_{1}=(25-6y_{1})\times y_{1}=19y_{1}-6y_{2}^{2}$$

For country 2, the profit is given by: 
$$\pi_{2}=(P_{joint}-TC(y_{2}))\times y_{2}=(25-6y_{2})\times y_{2}=19y_{2}-6y_{2}^{2}$$

The collusive agreement leads to higher profits for a country compared to the equilibrium in (b). 

This collusive agreement is unlikely to be stable since any member of the agreement can increase their profits by deviating from the agreement and producing more than their agreed upon output.
