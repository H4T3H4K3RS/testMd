## Model Parameters

In mathematical statistics, a model parameter is an unknown quantity that needs to be determined in order to complete a statistical model. A model parameter can be estimated from data, or it can be known a priori.

The most commonly used model parameters are the mean and variance of a distribution, which are usually estimated from data. Other parameters of a model may include coefficients from a linear regression, probabilities in a logistic regression, or the parameters of an autoregressive model.

## Estimation of Model Parameters

Model parameters can be estimated in a variety of ways. The most common method is to use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). MLE is a method of estimating parameters by finding the values that maximize the likelihood of the data given the model.

Another popular method of estimation is Bayesian estimation. This method combines prior knowledge of model parameters with observed data to estimate the parameters.

The least squares method is also used to estimate model parameters. This method finds the parameters that minimize the sum of squared errors between the observed data and the model.

## Confidence Intervals

When estimating model parameters, it is important to consider the uncertainty associated with the estimates. Confidence intervals are used to quantify this uncertainty. 

A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of the parameter with a certain probability. Confidence intervals are usually calculated using the standard error of the parameter estimate.

## Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is used to determine whether an estimated parameter is statistically significant. In a hypothesis test, a null hypothesis is proposed that states that the parameter is equal to some predetermined value. The alternative hypothesis is that the parameter is not equal to that value. The test is then used to determine the probability that the parameter is different from the predetermined value.

If the probability is less than some predetermined level (usually 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted. This means that the parameter is statistically significant.
