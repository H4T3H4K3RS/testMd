Collusion is an agreement between two or more firms to cooperate in the market rather than compete. When firms collude, they typically aim to increase their collective profits by setting higher prices and reducing output. However, this means that consumers will pay higher prices and receive fewer goods than if the market was competitive. As a result, collusion is not socially desirable because it leads to an allocation of resources that is not efficient and does not maximize consumer welfare.
