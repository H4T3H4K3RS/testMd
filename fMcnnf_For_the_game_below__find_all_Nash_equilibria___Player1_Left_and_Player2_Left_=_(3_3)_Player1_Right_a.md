# **Solution**

The game presented above can be represented as a matrix:

$
\begin{bmatrix}
(3,3) & (2,0) \\
(0,2) & (1,1)
\end{bmatrix}
$

A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from their strategy. In other words, a Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies such that no player can do better by changing only their own strategy.

The Nash equilibria for the game above are:

## **Nash Equilibria**

- (Left, Left): Both players choose Left, yielding a payoff of (3,3).
- (Right, Right): Both players choose Right, yielding a payoff of (1,1).
