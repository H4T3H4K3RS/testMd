**False** 

A subgame-perfect equilibrium strategy can include a non-credible threat. A non-credible threat is a threat that is not backed up by a credible commitment to carry out the threat.

In game theory, a subgame-perfect equilibrium (SPE) is a refinement of a Nash equilibrium. It is a Nash equilibrium that takes into account the effects of strategies chosen in the whole game on the players' strategies in the subgames. Subgame-perfect equilibria are used to capture the idea that players may have the ability to make binding commitments, and therefore can credibly threaten to take certain actions in the future.

In a subgame-perfect equilibrium, a player may choose a strategy that includes a non-credible threat, as long as that strategy is in the player's best interest. A non-credible threat may be used to gain an advantage in a particular subgame, and therefore can be part of a subgame-perfect equilibrium strategy.
