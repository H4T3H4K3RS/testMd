**A. Draw the Payoff Graph for this Strategy at the Option Expiration Date**

The payoff graph is a graph of the profit (or loss) at the option expiration date. The x-axis represents the price of the stock at the expiration date and the y-axis represents the payoff. In this case, we have two payoffs: one from the call option written and one from the call option bought. The payoff from the call option written is the difference between the exercise price of the option and the price of the stock at expiration. If the stock price is below the exercise price, the payoff is zero. If the stock price is above the exercise price, the payoff is equal to the difference between the stock price and the exercise price. The payoff from the call option bought is the difference between the stock price and the strike price of the option. If the stock price is below the exercise price, the payoff is zero. If the stock price is above the exercise price, the payoff is equal to the difference between the stock price and the exercise price.

**B. Draw the Profit Graph for this Strategy**

The profit graph is a graph of the profit (or loss) at the option expiration date. The x-axis represents the price of the stock at the expiration date and the y-axis represents the profit or loss. In this case, we have two profits or losses: one from the call option written and one from the call option bought. The profit from the call option written is the difference between the premium received and the difference between the exercise price of the option and the price of the stock at expiration. The profit from the call option bought is the difference between the premium paid and the difference between the stock price and the strike price of the option.

**C. What is the Break-Even Point for this Strategy? Is the Investor Bullish or Bearish on the Stock?**

The break-even point for this strategy is the price at which the investor will neither make a profit nor a loss. This can be calculated by taking the difference between the premiums received and paid and dividing it by two. In this case, the difference between the premiums received and paid is $6 ($9 - $3 = $6). The break-even point for this strategy is therefore $53 ($6/2 = $3).

The investor is bullish on the stock as they are expecting the stock price to rise above the break-even point of $53. If the stock price rises above this point, they will make a profit. If the stock price remains below this point, they will make a loss.
