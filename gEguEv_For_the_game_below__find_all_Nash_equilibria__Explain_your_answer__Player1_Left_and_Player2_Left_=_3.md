| Player2 | Player1 \ Player2 | Left | Right |
|---------|------------------|------|-------|
| Left    | 3.3              | 3.3  | 2.0   |
| Right   | 0.2              | 0.2  | 1.1   |

The Nash equilibrium of this game is **(Player1-Left, Player2-Left)**. This means that both players have an incentive to choose the same action, Left, as it yields the highest payoff for both players. If both players choose the same action, they will both receive a payoff of 3.3. If either player chooses a different action, then their payoff will decrease. For example, if Player1 chooses Right, their payoff will be 2.0 compared to 3.3 if they choose Left. Similarly, if Player2 chooses Right, their payoff will be 1.1 compared to 3.3 if they choose Left. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium is (Player1-Left, Player2-Left).
