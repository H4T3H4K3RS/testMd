**Solution**

The Residual Demand functions for Country 1 and Country 2 are given by: 

$$R_1(y_2)=30-y_1-y_2$$
$$R_2(y_1)=30-y_1-y_2$$

The Marginal Revenues for Country 1 and Country 2 are given by: 

$$MR_1(y_2)=\frac{\partial R_1(y_2)}{\partial y_1}=-1$$
$$MR_2(y_1)=\frac{\partial R_2(y_1)}{\partial y_2}=-1$$

The Reaction curves for Country 1 and Country 2 are given by: 

$$R_1(y_2)=6-y_2$$
$$R_2(y_1)=6-y_1$$

The graph of the Reaction curves is given below:
