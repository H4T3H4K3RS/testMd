**a. What is the value of a one-month call option with an exercise price of $50?**

The value of a one-month call option with an exercise price of $50 is $11.9. This is calculated as follows:

$50 \times \Delta = $11.9

where $\Delta$ is the option delta, which is calculated as follows:

$\Delta = (e^{0.127/12} - e^{-0.167/12})/ (e^{0.127/12} + e^{-0.167/12}) = 0.37$

**b. What is the option delta?**

The option delta for the one-month call option with an exercise price of $50 is 0.37.

**c. Show how the payoffs of this call option can be replicated by buying P&Gâ€™s stock and borrowing.**

We can replicate the payoffs of the one-month call option with an exercise price of $50 by buying P&G's stock and borrowing. Specifically, we can buy 1 unit of P&G's stock for $50 and borrow an amount $18.3 (calculated as $11.9/0.37) at the interest rate of 12.7% per year. This will give us a payoff of $68 (calculated as $50 + $18.3 x 1.127) at the end of the one-month period.

**d. What is the value of a two-month call option with an exercise price of $50?**

The value of the two-month call option with an exercise price of $50 is $14.5. This is calculated as follows:

$50 \times \Delta = $14.5

where $\Delta$ is the option delta, which is calculated as follows:

$\Delta = (e^{0.127/12 \times 2} - e^{-0.167/12 \times 2})/ (e^{0.127/12 \times 2} + e^{-0.167/12 \times 2}) = 0.44$

**e. What is the option delta of the two-month call over the first one-month period?**

The option delta of the two-month call over the first one-month period is 0.07. This is calculated as follows:

$\Delta_{2M} - \Delta_{1M} = 0.44 - 0.37 = 0.07$
