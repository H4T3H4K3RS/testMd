# **In Conclusion: A Comprehensive Approach to ICT Outsourcing**

The successful implementation of ICT outsourcing projects requires a comprehensive and holistic approach that takes into account all relevant aspects of information systems management, including project management and ICT governance. Effective project management ensures that the project is well-planned and executed, with clear communication between the vendor and the organization, and a thorough risk management plan. Effective ICT governance ensures that the outsourcing arrangement is aligned with business objectives and regulatory requirements, and that performance is monitored and measured to ensure that the project is providing value to the organization.

In the case of the Cambridge University NHS Foundation Trust and Epic, a focus on project management and ICT governance may have helped to mitigate the issues that arose during the implementation of the online patient record system. A comprehensive and holistic approach to ICT outsourcing is therefore essential to ensure the success of such projects.
