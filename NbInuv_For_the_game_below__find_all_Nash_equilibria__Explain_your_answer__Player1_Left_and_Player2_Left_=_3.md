| --- | --- | --- |
| Left | 3.3 | 0.2 |
| Right | 2.0 | 1.1 |

A Nash equilibrium occurs when both players in a game have reached a point in which they cannot improve their payoff by changing their strategies. In the above game, the Nash equilibria are (Left, Left) and (Right, Right). This is because if either of the players changes their strategy, they will be worse off. 

For example, if player 1 changes their strategy to Right, they will receive a payoff of 2.0 instead of 3.3, which is worse than their current payoff. Similarly, if player 2 changes their strategy to Left, they will receive a payoff of 0.2 instead of 1.1, which is worse than their current payoff. Therefore, (Left, Left) and (Right, Right) are the Nash equilibria of the game.
