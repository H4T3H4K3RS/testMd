The profit and loss function for market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously is given by:

$$P\&L=\phi_{1} \times \left( \Delta P_{1} \times Q_{1} \right)+\phi_{2} \times \left( \Delta P_{2} \times Q_{2} \right)$$

where $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$ are the prices of the two markets, $\Delta P_{1}$ and $\Delta P_{2}$ are the price changes of the two markets, and $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are the quantities of the two markets.
