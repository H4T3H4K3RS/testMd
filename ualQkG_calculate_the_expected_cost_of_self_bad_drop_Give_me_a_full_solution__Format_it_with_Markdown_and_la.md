# **Solution to Calculate the Expected Cost of Self Bad Drop**

The expected cost of self bad drop can be calculated using the following equation: 

$$Expected\ Cost = Probability\ of\ Success \cdot Gain\ from\ Success - Probability\ of\ Failure \cdot Cost\ of\ Failure$$

Where, 

* $Probability\ of\ Success$ = Probability of successfully dropping the item 
* $Gain\ from\ Success$ = Potential gain from successfully dropping the item 
* $Probability\ of\ Failure$ = Probability of failing to drop the item 
* $Cost\ of\ Failure$ = Cost of failing to drop the item 

Therefore, 

$$Expected\ Cost = P_s \cdot G - P_f \cdot C$$ 

Where, 

* $P_s$ = Probability of successfully dropping the item 
* $G$ = Potential gain from successfully dropping the item 
* $P_f$ = Probability of failing to drop the item 
* $C$ = Cost of failing to drop the item
