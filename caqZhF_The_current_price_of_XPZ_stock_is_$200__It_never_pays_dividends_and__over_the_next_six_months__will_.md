a. The price of a European call option with a strike price of $220 and six months to maturity is $19.85 and the price of a European put option with a strike price of $220 and six months to maturity is $20.15.

b. Put-call parity states that the price of a call option and a put option with the same strike price and maturity should be equal.

$$Call Option + Xe^{-rt} = Put Option + S$$

Substituting in the values from the question:

$$19.85 + 220e^{-0.02*0.5} = 20.15 + 200$$

$$19.85 + 220e^{-0.01} = 20.15 + 200$$

$$19.85 + 219.99 = 20.15 + 200$$

$$439.84 = 420.15$$

The equation holds, so put-call parity holds for the option prices computed in the question.

c. The payoff function for an at the money straddle on XPZ is given by:

$$Payoff(XPZ Straddle) = max(S-K, 0) + max(K-S, 0)$$

Where S is the stock price and K is the strike price.

Using the Black-Scholes formula, the price of the straddle is given by:

$$Straddle Price = C(S,K,r,t) + P(S,K,r,t)$$

Substituting in the values from the question:

$$Straddle Price = C(200,220,0.02,0.5) + P(200,220,0.02,0.5)$$

$$Straddle Price = 19.85 + 20.15$$

$$Straddle Price = 40$$

The payoff function of the straddle is shown in the graph below.
