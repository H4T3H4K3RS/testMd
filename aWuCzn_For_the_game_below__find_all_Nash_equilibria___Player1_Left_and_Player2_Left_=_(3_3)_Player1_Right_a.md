# **Solution**

A Nash Equilibrium is an outcome of a game where no player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy.

In this game, there are two players, Player1 and Player2, and they have two options each: Left or Right. The payoffs associated with each strategy combination are given in the question. 

## **Finding Nash Equilibria**

We can find the Nash Equilibria by evaluating each strategy combination and determining if either player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy.

### **Player1-Left and Player2-Left**

In this strategy combination, Player1 receives a payoff of 3 and Player2 receives a payoff of 3. 

If Player1 deviates from their chosen strategy of Left and plays Right instead, they will receive a payoff of 2. Similarly, if Player2 deviates from their chosen strategy of Left and plays Right instead, they will receive a payoff of 0. 

Therefore, neither player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy, and this strategy combination is a Nash Equilibrium.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$(Left_1, Left_2) = (3,3)$$

### **Player1-Right and Player2-Left**

In this strategy combination, Player1 receives a payoff of 2 and Player2 receives a payoff of 0. 

If Player1 deviates from their chosen strategy of Right and plays Left instead, they will receive a payoff of 3. Similarly, if Player2 deviates from their chosen strategy of Left and plays Right instead, they will receive a payoff of 2. 

Therefore, neither player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy, and this strategy combination is a Nash Equilibrium.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$(Right_1, Left_2) = (2,0)$$

### **Player1-Left and Player2-Right**

In this strategy combination, Player1 receives a payoff of 0 and Player2 receives a payoff of 2. 

If Player1 deviates from their chosen strategy of Left and plays Right instead, they will receive a payoff of 1. Similarly, if Player2 deviates from their chosen strategy of Right and plays Left instead, they will receive a payoff of 3. 

Therefore, neither player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy, and this strategy combination is a Nash Equilibrium.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$(Left_1, Right_2) = (0,2)$$

### **Player1-Right and Player2-Right**

In this strategy combination, Player1 receives a payoff of 1 and Player2 receives a payoff of 1. 

If Player1 deviates from their chosen strategy of Right and plays Left instead, they will receive a payoff of 0. Similarly, if Player2 deviates from their chosen strategy of Right and plays Left instead, they will receive a payoff of 3. 

Therefore, neither player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy, and this strategy combination is a Nash Equilibrium.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$(Right_1, Right_2) = (1,1)$$

## **Conclusion**

Therefore, the four Nash Equilibria for this game are: 

$$(Left_1, Left_2) = (3,3)$$

$$(Right_1, Left_2) = (2,0)$$

$$(Left_1, Right_2) = (0,2)$$

$$(Right_1, Right_2) = (1,1)$$
