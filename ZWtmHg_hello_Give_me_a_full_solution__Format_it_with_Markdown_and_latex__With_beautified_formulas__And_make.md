# **Solution**

We will use the formula for the area of a circle, $A = \pi r^2$, to solve this problem.

## **Step 1**

We are given the circumference of the circle, $C = 60$ cm. We can use the formula for the circumference of a circle, $C = 2\pi r$, to solve for the radius, $r$.

$$60 = 2\pi r$$

$$\frac{60}{2\pi} = r$$

$$r = \frac{60}{2\pi} = 9.424777961$$

## **Step 2**

Now that we have the radius, we can use the formula for the area of a circle, $A = \pi r^2$, to solve for the area.

$$A = \pi \cdot \left(\frac{60}{2\pi}\right)^2 = \frac{900}{4\pi} = 225.94\text{ cm}^2$$

Therefore, the area of the circle is $225.94\text{ cm}^2$.
