### Profit and Loss Function for Chartist Agent Trading on Two Markets Simultaneously

The profit and loss (P&L) function of a chartist agent trading on two markets simultaneously can be defined as follows:

$$ P\&L = P_{1} + P_{2} - C $$

where,

- $P_{1}$ is the profit/loss made by the chartist agent in the first market;
- $P_{2}$ is the profit/loss made by the chartist agent in the second market;
- $C$ is the cost associated with the trading activities in either of the two markets.

This P&L function has been discussed in detail in the following research papers:
