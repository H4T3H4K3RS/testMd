# Profit and Loss Function for Agent Model in Stock Market

To model the profit and loss (P&L) of an agent trading in two markets simultaneously, we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Transaction Costs:** All trades in the market incur transaction costs. These costs are determined by the exchange in which the agent trades. 

2. **Market Impact:** When an agent trades in a market, the trade has an effect on the market. This effect is known as market impact and is determined by the size of the trade relative to the liquidity in the market.

3. **Price Difference:** The difference between the price of the same asset in the two markets that the agent is trading in.

4. **Trading Volume:** The amount of assets traded by the agent in each market.

The P&L function for the agent can be expressed as follows: 

$$ P\&L = (p_{out} - p_{in}) \cdot V_{out} - (T_{out} + T_{in}) \cdot V_{in} - \theta \cdot \sqrt{V_{out}} - \theta \cdot \sqrt{V_{in}} $$

Where: 

- $p_{out}$ is the price of the asset in the market where the agent is selling. 
- $p_{in}$ is the price of the asset in the market where the agent is buying.
- $V_{out}$ is the trading volume in the market where the agent is selling.
- $V_{in}$ is the trading volume in the market where the agent is buying.
- $T_{out}$ is the transaction cost for the market where the agent is selling.
- $T_{in}$ is the transaction cost for the market where the agent is buying.
- $\theta$ is the market impact parameter.
