# Observer Template

The Observer Template is a popular design pattern used in object-oriented programming to provide a means of communication between objects in a program. It is used to create a layer of abstraction between objects, so that changes made to one object can be reflected in another object without the two needing to be aware of each other.

## Pros

- **Encapsulation:** The Observer Template helps to promote encapsulation, as it keeps the implementation details of various objects within themselves, rather than having all objects know the implementation details of each other.

- **Extensibility:** The Observer Template can be used to add new objects to the system without needing to modify existing code, allowing for faster development and easier maintenance.

- **Loose coupling:** The Observer Template helps to reduce the amount of code coupling between objects, as changes made to one object can be reflected in other objects without the two needing to be tightly coupled.

## Cons

- **Performance:** Depending on the number of observers and the complexity of the code, the Observer Template can lead to decreased performance due to the extra overhead of having to update all of the observers.

- **Error Prone:** The Observer Template can lead to increased complexity, and could potentially lead to bugs or errors if not implemented correctly.

- **Difficult to debug:** The Observer Template can be difficult to debug, as changes made to one object may affect other objects without the programmer being aware.
