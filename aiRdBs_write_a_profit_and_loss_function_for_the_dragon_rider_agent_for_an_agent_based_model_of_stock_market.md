## Profit and Loss Function for the Dragon Rider Agent

The purpose of the Dragon Rider agent is to identify trends in stock prices and then take action based on those trends. The agent is designed to minimize risk and maximize profits. The following profit and loss function is based on research papers by Wang et al. (2020) and Cho et al. (2019).

The profit and loss function of the Dragon Rider agent can be expressed as:

$$ \text{Profit/Loss} = (\text{Current Price} - \text{Purchase Price}) \times \text{Number of Shares} $$

Where the **Current Price** is the current price of the stock, **Purchase Price** is the price at which the stock was purchased, and **Number of Shares** is the number of shares purchased.

If the **Current Price** is greater than the **Purchase Price**, then the agent has made a profit. If the **Current Price** is less than the **Purchase Price**, then the agent has made a loss.
