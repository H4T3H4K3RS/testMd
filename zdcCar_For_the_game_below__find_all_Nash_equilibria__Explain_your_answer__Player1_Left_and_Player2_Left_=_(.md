The Nash Equilibrium in this game is when both players choose their Right actions, as this is the only outcome in which neither player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen action. This is because if either player deviates from their Right action, they will receive a lower payoff than if they both stay with the Right action.

Therefore, the Nash Equilibrium in this game is (Right, Right) with payoffs of (1,1).
