# Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern used to define a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and let subclasses override certain steps of the algorithm without changing its overall structure.

## What is the Template Method Pattern?

The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and allows subclasses to provide specific implementation of the algorithm’s steps. The template method defines a set of steps that are common to all implementations of the algorithm, while the subclasses may redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

## Pros and Cons of the Template Method Pattern

### Pros
* It allows subclasses to reuse the parent’s implementation of the algorithm, resulting in more reusable and maintainable code.
* It encapsulates the algorithm and allows subclasses to customize the algorithm’s behavior without changing its overall structure.
* It can be used to decouple the code that implements the algorithm from the code that consumes it.

### Cons
* The parent class must define a concrete implementation of the algorithm, which can lead to tightly coupled code.
* It can be difficult to debug, since the algorithm is implemented in the parent class and all subclasses inherit the same behavior.
* It can lead to code duplication, since subclasses may override certain steps of the algorithm.
