# **Solution:**

This problem can be solved by using the approach proposed by [1], which outlines the following Profit and Loss (P&L) function:

$$P\&L = \sum_{j \in \{1,2\}} \left( (W_{j,t} - W_{j,t-1})\cdot p_{j,t} \right)$$

where $$W_{j,t}$$ is the wealth of the agent at time $$t$$ in market $$j$$, $$p_{j,t}$$ is the price of the asset in market $$j$$ at time $$t$$.
