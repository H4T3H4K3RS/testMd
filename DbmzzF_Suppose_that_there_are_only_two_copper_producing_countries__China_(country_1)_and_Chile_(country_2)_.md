**Solution:**

**Residual Demands:**

The residual demand for Country 1, denoted by $R_1$ is given by

$$R_1 = P(Q) - P(y_2)$$

$$\implies R_1 = 30 - y_1 - y_2$$ 

Similarly, the residual demand for Country 2, denoted by $R_2$ is given by

$$R_2 = P(Q) - P(y_1)$$

$$\implies R_2 = 30 - y_1 - y_2$$ 

Since, both countries have the same inverse demand function, their residual demands will be identical.

**Marginal Revenues:**

The marginal revenue for Country 1, denoted by $MR_1$ is given by

$$MR_1 = \frac{\partial R_1}{\partial y_1} = -1$$

Similarly, the marginal revenue for Country 2, denoted by $MR_2$ is given by

$$MR_2 = \frac{\partial R_2}{\partial y_2} = -1$$

Since, the marginal revenue is the same for both countries.

**Reaction Functions:**

The reaction function for Country 1, denoted by $y_1(R_1)$ is given by

$$y_1(R_1) = \min \left\{ \frac{R_1 + y_2}{2} , \frac{TC_1(y_1)}{MR_1} \right\}$$

$$\implies y_1(R_1) = \min \left\{ \frac{R_1 + y_2}{2} , 6 \right\}$$

Similarly, the reaction function for Country 2, denoted by $y_2(R_2)$ is given by

$$y_2(R_2) = \min \left\{ \frac{R_2 + y_1}{2} , \frac{TC_2(y_2)}{MR_2} \right\}$$

$$\implies y_2(R_2) = \min \left\{ \frac{R_2 + y_1}{2} , 6 \right\}$$

The intersection of the reaction curves gives us the Nash Equilibrium of the game.
