**True** 

Collusion between firms with identical constant marginal cost will generally lead to an allocation that is not socially desirable because it does not maximize consumer surplus or social welfare.

When two firms with identical constant marginal cost collude, they will set a price that maximizes their joint profits. This results in a market price and quantity that is higher than what would be obtained under perfect competition. As a result, consumer surplus and social welfare are reduced. 

The following equations show the optimal price and quantity for profit maximization under collusion and for perfect competition. 

**Collusion**

Price: $P_c = \frac{MC_1 + MC_2}{2}$ 

Quantity: $Q_c = \frac{D}{2}$ 

**Perfect Competition**

Price: $P_f = MC_1 = MC_2$ 

Quantity: $Q_f = D$ 

Where $D$ is the market demand. 

It can be seen that the price and quantity under collusion are higher than under perfect competition. This indicates that consumer surplus and social welfare are lower under collusion than under perfect competition.
