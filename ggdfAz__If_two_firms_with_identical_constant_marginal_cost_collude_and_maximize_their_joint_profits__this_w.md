Collusion between firms with identical constant marginal costs can lead to an allocation that is not socially desirable. This is because, under collusion, firms have the incentive to set prices higher than the competitive price level, which reduces the producer and consumer surplus and leads to a lower welfare level.

To better understand why collusion between firms with identical constant marginal costs can lead to an allocation that is not socially desirable, we can consider the following example. Suppose two firms have identical constant marginal costs of $c$ and the market demand is given by $Q = a - bP$, where $Q$ is the quantity demanded, $P$ is the price, and $a$ and $b$ are positive constants. 

Under competition, each firm produces a quantity of $Q_c = \dfrac{a}{2b}$ and charges a price of $P_c = \dfrac{a}{2b}$, which yields a profit of $Ï€_c = \dfrac{a^2}{8b}$. 

In contrast, under collusion, the firms can set a price $P_m > P_c$ and produce a quantity $Q_m < Q_c$. This will lead to higher profits for the firms, but it will also lead to a welfare loss for the consumers and a deadweight loss for the society. The deadweight loss is given by 

$$DWL = \dfrac{1}{2}(P_m - P_c)(Q_c - Q_m)$$

Therefore, collusion between firms with identical constant marginal costs can lead to an allocation that is not socially desirable.
