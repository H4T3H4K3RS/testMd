## **Solution**

We can find the extremum of the function $f(x)$ by finding its critical points and then determining whether the points are local maxima, local minima, or neither.

### **Critical Points**

We can find the critical points of $f(x)$ by finding the points where its derivative is equal to 0. The derivative of $f(x)$ is:

$$f'(x) = \frac{4x^3}{(x^3-1)^2} - \frac{x^4}{(x^3-1)^2} = \frac{3x^3}{(x^3-1)^2}$$

Setting $f'(x) = 0$ and solving for $x$, we get:

$$\frac{3x^3}{(x^3-1)^2} = 0 \implies x^3 = 1 \implies x = 1$$

Thus, the critical point of $f(x)$ is $x = 1$.

### **Extremum**

We can determine the type of extremum of $f(x)$ at its critical point by evaluating the second derivative of the function at the critical point. The second derivative of $f(x)$ is:

$$f''(x) = \frac{12x^2(x^3-1) - 6x^4}{(x^3-1)^3}$$

Evaluating $f''(x)$ at the critical point $x = 1$, we get:

$$f''(1) = \frac{12(1-1)-6(1)}{(1-1)^3} = 0$$

Since the second derivative of the function is equal to 0 at the critical point, this indicates that the critical point is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum. Thus, the function $f(x)$ has no extremum.
