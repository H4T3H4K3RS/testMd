# Exploiting Information Infrastructure Value 

Organisations need to plan and manage the deployment and integration of their information and communication technologies (ICTs) in order to effectively exploit the value generated by their information infrastructure. To accomplish this, managers need to understand the characteristics of the available ICTs and how they work, both as stand-alone systems and as part of integrated information infrastructures.

## Personal ICT

Personal ICTs are technologies used by individual members of an organisation to carry out their daily tasks. Examples of personal ICTs include desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. These technologies enable individuals to access information, communicate with others, and collaborate on projects.

## Group ICT

Group ICTs are technologies used by a group of people to work together to achieve a common goal. Examples of group ICTs include web conferencing, video conferencing, and group messaging applications. These technologies allow a group of people to share information and collaborate on tasks in real-time.

## Design and Organisation of ICTs

In order to design, organise and maintain efficient and effective information infrastructures, managers need to understand the characteristics of the available ICTs and how they work. They must also assess the needs of the organisation in order to determine which ICTs should be used and in what manner.

The organisation's ICTs must be integrated into a cohesive whole in order to support the organisation's strategic objectives. This will require the integration of both personal and group ICTs, as well as the development of policies, procedures and processes to ensure that the ICTs are optimally utilised.

## Maintenance of ICTs

Once the ICTs have been deployed and integrated, they must be regularly maintained and upgraded in order to ensure they remain secure and up-to-date. This will involve regular patching and updating of the ICTs, as well as the implementation of security measures to protect them from malicious attacks.

In addition, the organisation will need to develop a plan for the long-term maintenance of its ICTs. This plan should include regular backups, periodic audits, and the implementation of new technologies as they become available.

By understanding the characteristics of the available ICTs, assessing the needs of the organisation, and developing plans for the integration and maintenance of the ICTs, managers can ensure that their organisation's information infrastructure is optimally deployed and maintained. This will enable the organisation to effectively exploit the value generated by its information infrastructure.
