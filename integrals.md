An integral is a mathematical concept used to calculate the area under a curve or the total amount of change between two points. The process of finding an integral is called integration. There are two types of integrals: definite and indefinite.

Definite Integral
A definite integral has specific limits of integration, denoted by the notation:

$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx$$

This represents the definite integral of $f(x)$ with respect to x, evaluated between the limits $a$ and $b$.

Indefinite Integral
An indefinite integral, on the other hand, does not have specific limits. It is represented by an antiderivative of a function, denoted by the notation:

$$\int f(x)dx = F(x) + C$$

Where $F(x)$ is the antiderivative of $f(x)$ and $C$ is the constant of integration.

Methods of Solving Integrals
There are several methods for solving integrals, including:

Substitution: This method involves substituting a new variable for the original variable in the integral.

Integration by parts: This method involves multiplying the function inside the integral by the derivative of another function, and then integrating both sides.

Trigonometric identities: This method involves using trigonometric identities to simplify the function inside the integral before solving.

Partial fractions: This method is used when the function inside the integral is a fraction and cannot be integrated directly.

Trigonometric substitution : This method is used when the integral includes a square root of a quadratic polynomial in the form $(a^2-x^2)$ or $(x^2-a^2)$.

Improper Integrals
An improper integral is an integral that either has an infinite limit of integration or an integrand that becomes infinite at one or more points in the interval of integration. Improper integrals can be either convergent or divergent.

There are two types of Improper Integrals:

Type I Improper Integral: The integral is improper due to an infinite limit of integration, such as:
$$\int_{1}^{\infty} f(x)dx$$

Type II Improper Integral: The integral is improper due to an infinite value of the integrand at one or more points in the interval of integration, such as:
$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx$$

where $f(x)$ becomes infinite at some point $x=c$ in the interval $[a,b]$.

Improper integrals can be convergent or divergent. Convergent means the integral has a finite value, divergent means it is infinite.

It is important to note that the techniques for solving improper integrals are different from those for solving proper integrals.
There are several techniques to evaluate improper integrals, including:

Integrating by parts: This method involves manipulating the integral to make it converge.

Trigonometric substitution: This method involves making a substitution in the integral using trigonometric functions.

Partial fraction decomposition: This method involves breaking the integrand into simpler fractions to make it easier to integrate.

Cauchy principal value: This method assigns a specific value to the integral by defining the integral as the limit of a certain expression.

Residue calculus: This method involves finding the residues of the integrand at its poles in the complex plane.

Numerical methods: This method involves approximating the value of the integral using numerical techniques such as trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, or Monte Carlo method.

It's worth noting that not all improper integrals can be evaluated, and some integrals may require more advanced techniques or special functions to evaluate.

A proper integral is a type of definite integral where the limits of integration are finite and the integral converges to a finite value. In other words, it is an integral where the area under the curve represented by the integrand is finite.

The definite integral is defined as the difference between the definite integral of the upper limit and the definite integral of the lower limit.

A proper integral is generally written as:

$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$$

where $a$ and $b$ are the lower and upper limits of integration respectively, and $f(x)$ is the integrand. The definite integral of $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$, denoted by $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$, represents the area between the curve $y = f(x)$ and the x-axis, between $x = a$ and $x = b$.

It's worth noting that not all definite integrals are proper integrals, for example, an improper integral is a type of definite integral where the limits of integration are finite but the integral does not converge to a finite value.

There are several techniques to evaluate proper integrals, including:

Antiderivative: This method involves finding the antiderivative of the integrand, which is also known as the indefinite integral.

Substitution: This method involves making a substitution in the integral to simplify the integrand and make it easier to integrate.

Integration by parts: This method involves manipulating the integral by applying the product rule of calculus.

Trigonometric substitution: This method involves making a substitution in the integral using trigonometric functions.

Partial fraction decomposition: This method involves breaking the integrand into simpler fractions to make it easier to integrate.

Tables of integrals: This method involves looking up the integral in a table of known integrals.

Numerical methods: This method involves approximating the value of the integral using numerical techniques such as trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, or Monte Carlo method.

It's worth noting that not all proper integrals have a closed form solution and some integrals may require more advanced techniques or special functions to evaluate. Also, some integrals may be too difficult to evaluate analytically, in these cases numerical methods are the way to go.
