**Solution**

The profit and loss function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously can be modeled based on the research paper published by [Chakravarty et. al. (2013)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-012-1220-z).

The profit and loss (P&L) function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously is given by:

$$ P\&L = \sum_{i} \left[ \left(q_i^p - q_i^m\right) \left(p_i^p - p_i^m\right) \right] + \sum_{j} \left[ \left(q_j^p - q_j^m\right) \left(p_j^p - p_j^m\right) \right] $$

where,

- $q_i^p$ and $q_i^m$ denote the quantity of asset $i$ bought and sold respectively in market $p$  
- $p_i^p$ and $p_i^m$ denote the price of asset $i$ bought and sold respectively in market $p$  
- $q_j^p$ and $q_j^m$ denote the quantity of asset $j$ bought and sold respectively in market $q$  
- $p_j^p$ and $p_j^m$ denote the price of asset $j$ bought and sold respectively in market $q$  

The profit and loss (P&L) for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously is therefore a function of the quantity of the assets bought and sold in each market, as well as the prices of the assets bought and sold in each market.
