## Event A
A: Exactly one element failed

This event can be described in statistical terms as follows:

$$A = \sum_{i=1}^3 P(A_i) - \sum_{i\neq j} P(A_i \cap A_j)$$

Where $P(A_i)$ is the probability of failure of the i-th element, and $P(A_i \cap A_j)$ is the probability of the simultaneous failure of the i-th and j-th element.

## Event B
B: At least one element failed

This event can be described in statistical terms as follows:

$$B = 1 - P(\bar{A_1} \cap \bar{A_2} \cap \bar{A_3})$$

Where $\bar{A_i}$ is the event of the non-failure of the i-th element, and $P(\bar{A_1} \cap \bar{A_2} \cap \bar{A_3})$ is the probability of non-failure of all three elements.

## Event C
C: Exactly two elements failed

This event can be described in statistical terms as follows:

$$C = \sum_{i\neq j} P(A_i \cap A_j) - \sum_{i\neq j \neq k}P(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k)$$

Where $P(A_i \cap A_j)$ is the probability of simultaneous failure of the i-th and j-th element, and $P(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k)$ is the probability of simultaneous failure of three elements.

## Event D
D: At least two elements failed

This event can be described in statistical terms as follows:

$$D = 1 - P(\bar{A_1} \cap \bar{A_2}) - P(\bar{A_1} \cap \bar{A_3}) - P(\bar{A_2} \cap \bar{A_3})$$

Where $\bar{A_i}$ is the event of the non-failure of the i-th element, and $P(\bar{A_1} \cap \bar{A_2})$, $P(\bar{A_1} \cap \bar{A_3})$, and $P(\bar{A_2} \cap \bar{A_3})$ are the probabilities of non-failure of two elements.

## Event E
E: Exactly three elements failed

This event can be described in statistical terms as follows:

$$E = P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3)$$

Where $P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3)$ is the probability of simultaneous failure of three elements.

## Event K
K: No more than two elements failed

This event can be described in statistical terms as follows:

$$K = P(\bar{A_1} \cap \bar{A_2}) + P(\bar{A_1} \cap \bar{A_3}) + P(\bar{A_2} \cap \bar{A_3}) + P(A_1 \cap A_2) + P(A_1 \cap A_3) + P(A_2 \cap A_3)$$

Where $\bar{A_i}$ is the event of the non-failure of the i-th element, and $P(\bar{A_1} \cap \bar{A_2})$, $P(\bar{A_1} \cap \bar{A_3})$, and $P(\bar{A_2} \cap \bar{A_3})$ are the probabilities of non-failure of two elements, and $P(A_1 \cap A_2)$, $P(A_1 \cap A_3)$, and $P(A_2 \cap A_3)$ are the probabilities of simultaneous failure of two elements.
