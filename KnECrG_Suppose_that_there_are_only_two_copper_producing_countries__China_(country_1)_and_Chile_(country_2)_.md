**Solution:**

**Residual Demand**

The residual demand of country 1 is given by:

$$RD_1 = P(Q) - MC_1 = 30 - Y - 6y_1$$

and the residual demand of country 2 is given by:

$$RD_2 = P(Q) - MC_2 = 30 - Y - 6y_2$$

**Marginal Revenue**

The marginal revenue of country 1 is given by:

$$MR_1 = \frac{\partial RD_1}{\partial y_1} = -6$$

and the marginal revenue of country 2 is given by:

$$MR_2 = \frac{\partial RD_2}{\partial y_2} = -6$$

**Reaction Functions**

The reaction function of country 1 is given by:

$$y_1 = \frac{30 - Y - 6y_2}{6} = \frac{30 - Y}{6} - y_2$$

and the reaction function of country 2 is given by:

$$y_2 = \frac{30 - Y - 6y_1}{6} = \frac{30 - Y}{6} - y_1$$

**Reaction Curves**

The reaction curves are shown in the graph below:
