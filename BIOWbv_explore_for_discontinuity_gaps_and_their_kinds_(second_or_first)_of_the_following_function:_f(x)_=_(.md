## **Solution**
The given function is:

$f(x) = \frac{2|x-1|}{x^2 - x^4}$

Let us analyze the function for discontinuity gaps and their kinds.

### **Domain of the Function**

The domain of the function can be determined by considering the denominator of the function:

$x^2 - x^4 = 0 \Rightarrow x^2(1-x^2) = 0 \Rightarrow x = 0, \pm 1$

Therefore, the domain of the function is:

$\mathbb{D}= \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \neq 0, \pm 1\}$

### **Kinds of Discontinuity**

The function $f(x)$ is discontinuous at $x = 0, \pm 1$

We will analyze the discontinuity at $x = 0$:

For $x \to 0^+$

$\lim_{x\to 0^+} f(x) = \frac{2|x-1|}{x^2 - x^4}$

$= \frac{2(0-1)}{0 - 0}$

$= \frac{-2}{0}$ (which is undefined)

For $x \to 0^-$

$\lim_{x\to 0^-} f(x) = \frac{2|x-1|}{x^2 - x^4}$

$= \frac{2(-0-1)}{-0 - (-0)}$

$= \frac{2}{0}$ (which is undefined)

Therefore, the function is discontinuous at $x = 0$ and the discontinuity is of the **first kind**.

Similarly, we can analyze the discontinuity at $x = \pm 1$ and find that the discontinuity is also of the **first kind**.

Therefore, the function $f(x) = \frac{2|x-1|}{x^2 - x^4}$ has discontinuities of the **first kind** at $x = 0, \pm 1$.
