## Solution

The equation is:

$y = x^2 - 6x + 5$

We can plot the graph of this equation by finding some points.

### Points

To find the points, we can substitute different values of $x$ in the equation to calculate $y$:

| $x$ | $y$ |
|-----|-----|
| -3 | 14 |
| -2 | 7  |
| -1 | 4  |
| 0  | 5  |
| 1  | 4  |
| 2  | 7  |
| 3  | 14 |
