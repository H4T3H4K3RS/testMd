## **The Relationship between Decision Function and Rejection Region**

A decision function is a mathematical expression that produces an output value given a set of input values. It is typically used in a decision-making process to determine the optimal action to take based on the inputs.

A rejection region is a subset of a decision space that is considered to be unacceptable. It is used to identify what input values should be rejected in order to produce a desired output.

The relationship between a decision function and a rejection region is that the decision function defines the region of accepted inputs, while the rejection region defines the region of rejected inputs.

The decision function is used to determine which inputs should be accepted and which should be rejected. This is done by comparing the output of the decision function to a predetermined threshold. Any input values that produce an output value greater than the threshold are accepted, while any that produce an output value less than or equal to the threshold are rejected.

The rejection region is the set of all input values that produce an output value less than or equal to the threshold. This region is used to identify which inputs should be rejected in order to produce a desired output.

Mathematically, the relationship between a decision function and a rejection region can be expressed as follows:

$$
f(x) \begin{cases} 
      > T & \text{accepted} \\
      \leq T & \text{rejected} 
   \end{cases}
$$

where $f(x)$ is the decision function, $T$ is the predetermined threshold, and $x$ is the set of input values. Any input values that produce an output value greater than the threshold are accepted, while any that produce an output value less than or equal to the threshold are rejected.
