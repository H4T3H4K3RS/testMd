**Solution to why the Function `func1` is not Allowed in Code**

This could be due to several reasons. To provide a full solution, we will look at two possible causes:

- Incorrect Syntax:
  - If `func1` is not properly written, then it might be causing the code to not work correctly. To fix this, we need to make sure that the syntax of the function is correct. This includes checking for typos, making sure all the necessary parameters are passed to the function, and ensuring that all the brackets and commas are in the right places.

- Unsupported Programming Language:
  - If the programming language that is being used is not supported by the function, then it will not work. To fix this, we need to make sure that the language that is being used is supported by the function. If not, we may need to look into using a different language or finding a library that supports the language.
