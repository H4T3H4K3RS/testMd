# Solution

The game given is a two-player, two-strategy game, represented in the following payoff matrix:

| Player 2 | Left | Right |
| -------- | ---- | ----- |
| Left     | 3,3  | 0,2   |
| Right    | 2,0  | 1,1   |

A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies in which no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from their chosen strategy.

## Nash Equilibrium

The Nash equilibria of the given game can be found by solving the following set of equations:

\begin{align}
3 &= \max(3,0) \\
3 &= \max(2,1) \\
2 &= \max(3,2) \\
0 &= \max(2,0)
\end{align}

The Nash equilibria of the game are therefore (Left, Left) and (Right, Right).
