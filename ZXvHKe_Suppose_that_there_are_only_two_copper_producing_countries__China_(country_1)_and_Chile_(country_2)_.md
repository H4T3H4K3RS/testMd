### (a)

The residual demand of each country can be written as:

$$y_{1}^{*} = \frac{30 - y_{2}}{2}$$

$$y_{2}^{*} = \frac{30 - y_{1}}{2}$$

The marginal revenues of each country can be written as:

$$MR_{1} = 30 - 2y_{1} - y_{2}$$

$$MR_{2} = 30 - y_{1} - 2y_{2}$$

The reaction functions of each country can be written as:


$$y_{1} = \frac{30 - y_{2}}{2}$$

$$y_{2} = \frac{30 - y_{1}}{2}$$

The graph of reaction curves is as follows:

### (b)

The profit-maximizing output levels of both countries, the market output and the market price can be calculated as:

$$y_{1}^{*} = \frac{30}{3}$$

$$y_{2}^{*} = \frac{30}{3}$$

$$Y^{*} = \frac{60}{3}$$

$$P^{*} = \frac{90}{3}$$

This equilibrium result is called Cournot equilibrium in economic literature. The graph of Cournot equilibrium is as follows:

This market outcome does not result in a market failure as both countries are able to maximize their profits.

### (c)

The joint marginal revenue can be written as:

$$MR = 30 - 3Y $$

The resulting joint output level and the market price can be calculated as:

$$Y = \frac{30}{3}$$

$$P = \frac{90}{3}$$

The collusive agreement leads to higher profits for a country compared to the equilibrium in (b). The graph of the collusive agreement is as follows:

This collusive agreement is likely to be stable as the countries are able to maximize their joint profits.
