# **Nash Equilibria**
A Nash Equilibrium is a set of strategies for a game such that each player's strategy is an optimal response to the strategies of the other players.

## **Game Matrix**
The following game matrix shows the payoffs for the game:

| Player2\Player1 | Left | Right |
|-----------------|------|-------|
| Left            | (3,3)| (2,0) |
| Right           | (0,2)| (1,1) |

## **Solution**
The Nash Equilibria for the game is:

\\[ \begin{cases} 
Player1: Left\\
Player2: Left 
\end{cases}\\]

This is the only Nash Equilibrium as it is the only strategy combination where both players are making an optimal decision. Both players are choosing the strategy that gives them the highest payoff in response to the other player's choice.
