**Nash Equilibria**

A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies for each player such that no player has an incentive to switch strategies given what other players are doing. A Nash equilibrium is said to exist when all players in the game are playing their Nash equilibrium strategies. 

In the game given, the Nash equilibria can be found by setting up a system of equations and solving for the Nash equilibria. We can represent the strategies for each player as follows:

Player 1: 

- Left (L)
- Right (R)

Player 2: 

- Left (L)
- Right (R)

The payoff matrix for the game is given by:

| | Player 2 | L | R |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Player 1 | L | 3.3 | 0.2 |
| | R | 2.0 | 1.1 |

Using this payoff matrix, we can set up a system of equations to find the Nash equilibria:

\begin{align}
    3.3 &\geq 2.0 \\
    0.2 &\geq 1.1
\end{align}

Since both of these inequalities are true, we can conclude that the Nash equilibrium for this game is (L, L). This means that both players should choose the Left strategy in order to achieve the Nash equilibrium.
