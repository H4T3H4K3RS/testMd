**Solution:** 

The option delta is defined as the change in the option price for a small change in the stock price. 

Let $S$ be the stock price of P&G, and $C$ be the option price. The option delta $\Delta$ can then be defined as:

$$ \Delta = \frac{\partial C}{\partial S} $$

We can calculate the option delta for the given information as follows:

First, we need to calculate the monthly change in the stock price, which is given by:

$$ \Delta S = S \cdot \frac{20\% - 16.7\%}{100} = S \cdot 0.033 $$

Now, we can calculate the option delta as:

$$ \Delta = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta S} = \frac{C(S + \Delta S) - C(S)}{S \cdot 0.033} $$

Plugging in the values, we get:

$$ \Delta = \frac{C(50 + 0.033 \cdot 50) - C(50)}{50 \cdot 0.033} = \frac{C(50.165) - C(50)}{1.65} $$

Finally, the option delta can be calculated as:

$$ \Delta = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta S} = \frac{C(50.165) - C(50)}{1.65}$$
