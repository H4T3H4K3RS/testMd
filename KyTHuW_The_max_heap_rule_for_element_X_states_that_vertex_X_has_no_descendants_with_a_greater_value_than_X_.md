**Solution**

The max-heap rule states that each element in a max-heap must be greater than or equal to all of its descendants. Therefore, if the number 14 in the array is replaced by the number 6, 3 elements will violate this rule: 1, 8, and 3.

The array after replacing the 14 with a 6 will be: [16, 3, 6, 1, 1, 8, 3, 1].

In this array, the element 6 has two descendants with a greater value, 8 and 3. The elements 1 and 8 also have descendants with a greater value, 3. Therefore, these three elements violate the max-heap rule.
