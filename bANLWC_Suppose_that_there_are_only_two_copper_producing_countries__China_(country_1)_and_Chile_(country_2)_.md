**(a) Finding Residual Demands and the Marginal Revenues**

The residual demand for country 1 is given by the difference between its inverse demand curve and the inverse demand curve of country 2: 

$ RD_{1}(y_{1}) = P(y_{1}+y_{2}) - P(y_{2}) = 30 - (y_{1}+y_{2}) - (30-y_{2}) = y_{1}$

The residual demand for country 2 is given by the difference between its inverse demand curve and the inverse demand curve of country 1:

$ RD_{2}(y_{2}) = P(y_{2}+y_{1}) - P(y_{1}) = 30 - (y_{1}+y_{2}) - (30-y_{1}) = y_{2}$

The marginal revenue for country 1 is given by the derivative of its residual demand:

$ MR_{1}(y_{1})=\frac{dRD_{1}}{dy_{1}}=1$

The marginal revenue for country 2 is given by the derivative of its residual demand:

$MR_{2}(y_{2})=\frac{dRD_{2}}{dy_{2}}=1$

The reaction functions of both countries are given by the inverse of the marginal revenues:

$y_{1} = \frac{1}{MR_{1}} = \frac{1}{1} = 1$

$y_{2} = \frac{1}{MR_{2}} = \frac{1}{1} = 1$

The reaction curves for both countries are shown in the graph below:

**(b) Calculating the Equilibrium Output and Price**

From the reaction curves in the graph above, we can see that the equilibrium output levels of both countries are equal to 1. The resulting market output is therefore equal to 2, and the market price is equal to 28 (thousands of dollars). This market outcome is called Cournot equilibrium.

This market outcome does not result in a market failure because it is efficient. The market price is equal to the marginal cost of production, and the market output is equal to the sum of the two firmsâ€™ output.

**(c) Calculating the Equilibrium Output and Price Under Collusion**

Under collusion, the joint marginal revenue is given by the sum of the two marginal revenues:

$MR_{total}(y_{1},y_{2})=MR_{1}(y_{1})+MR_{2}(y_{2})=1+1=2$

The joint output level is given by the inverse of the joint marginal revenue:

$y_{1}+y_{2}=\frac{1}{MR_{total}}=\frac{1}{2}=2$

The market price is given by the equation of the inverse demand curve:

$P = 30 - (y_{1} + y_{2}) = 30 - 2 = 28$ (thousands of dollars)

Under the assumption that each country produces one half of the total output, the profits of each country are equal to $14$ (thousands of dollars). This is higher than the profits each country earns in the Cournot equilibrium, which is equal to $12$ (thousands of dollars).

This collusive agreement is likely to be stable because the incentives for either country to deviate from the agreement are low. If one country deviates from the agreement, its profits will decrease because the market price will fall to $24$ (thousands of dollars). This is lower than the profits of $14$ (thousands of dollars) it earns under the agreement.
