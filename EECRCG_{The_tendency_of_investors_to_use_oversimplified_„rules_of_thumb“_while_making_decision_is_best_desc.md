Endowment bias is a cognitive bias that occurs when someone values something more highly just because they own it. It is a form of status quo bias, which is the preference for things to remain the same. People tend to overestimate the value of things they own and underestimate the value of things they do not own, which leads to irrational decision-making.

This bias can lead investors to make decisions that are not in their best interests. For example, they may hold onto an investment that is no longer profitable, simply because they already own it. This can lead to a reluctance to sell an asset, even if the potential return from doing so is greater than the return from holding it.

Endowment bias can also lead to a reluctance to invest in new opportunities, since investors may be more likely to invest in something that they already own. This can lead to missed opportunities for higher returns.

Overall, the tendency of investors to use oversimplified „rules of thumb“ while making decisions is best described by endowment bias. This bias can lead to irrational decision-making and missed opportunities for higher returns.
