If the market proxy portfolio is not highly correlated with the true market portfolio, it is possible that the stocks in the market proxy portfolio have nonzero alphas even if the true market portfolio is efficient. This is because the stocks in the proxy portfolio may have returns that are not perfectly correlated with the returns of the true market portfolio. In other words, the stocks in the proxy portfolio may have returns that are not perfectly captured by the returns of the true market portfolio. Therefore, even if the true market portfolio is efficient, the stocks in the proxy portfolio may still have nonzero alphas. 

Mathematically, this can be expressed as follows: 

Let $R_{m}$ be the return of the true market portfolio and let $R_{p}$ be the return of the proxy market portfolio. Then, the alpha of a stock $i$ can be expressed as: 

$$ \alpha_{i} = R_{i} - \beta_{i} R_{m}, $$

where $\beta_{i}$ is the beta coefficient of the stock $i$ with respect to the true market portfolio. 

If the proxy portfolio is not highly correlated with the true market portfolio, then $Cov(R_{p}, R_{m})$ will be small. Therefore, we can rewrite the alpha as follows: 

$$ \alpha_{i} = R_{i} - \beta_{i} R_{m} + \beta_{i} (R_{p} - R_{m}). $$

Since $\beta_{i} (R_{p} - R_{m})$ can be non-zero, it is possible for $\alpha_{i}$ to be non-zero even if the true market portfolio is efficient. 

Therefore, if the market proxy portfolio is not highly correlated with the true market portfolio, it is possible for stocks to have nonzero alphas even if the true market portfolio is efficient.
