**Solution:**

(a) The profit functions for both countries are given by:

* Country 1: $\pi_1 = P(y_1+y_2)(y_1) - TC(y_1) = (30-y_1-y_2)y_1 - 6y_1 = 24y_1 - 6y_1 - y_1y_2 = 17y_1 - y_1y_2$

* Country 2: $\pi_2 = P(y_1+y_2)(y_2) - TC(y_2) = (30-y_1-y_2)y_2 - 6y_2 = 24y_2 - 6y_2 - y_2y_1 = 17y_2 - y_2y_1$

(b) The profit-maximizing output levels of both countries can be found by setting the respective derivatives of their profit functions to zero.

For Country 1, we have:
$$
\frac{\partial \pi_1}{\partial y_1} = 17 - y_2 = 0 \\
\Rightarrow y_2 = 17
$$

Substituting this result into the profit function for Country 1, we have:
$$
\pi_1 = 17y_1 - 17y_1 = 0 \\
\Rightarrow y_1 = 0
$$

For Country 2, we have:
$$
\frac{\partial \pi_2}{\partial y_2} = 17 - y_1 = 0 \\
\Rightarrow y_1 = 17
$$

Substituting this result into the profit function for Country 2, we have:
$$
\pi_2 = 17y_2 - 17y_2 = 0 \\
\Rightarrow y_2 = 0
$$

Therefore, the profit-maximizing output levels of both countries are $y_1 = 0$ (for Country 1) and $y_2 = 0$ (for Country 2). The market output and the market price can then be found by substituting these values into the inverse demand function:

$$
P(Q) = P(y_1 + y_2) = 30 - (y_1 + y_2) = 30 - 0 = 30
$$

and 

$$
Q = y_1 + y_2 = 0 + 0 = 0
$$

This equilibrium result is called the Bertrand-Nash Equilibrium.

The graph of this market outcome is given below:

This market outcome does not result in a market failure. The output level of both countries is zero, which means that there is no over- or under-production of copper. The market price is also equal to the equilibrium price, which means that there is no deadweight loss due to prices being too high or too low.
