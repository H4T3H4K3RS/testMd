**a. What is the value of a one-month call option with an exercise price of $50?**

The value of a one-month call option with an exercise price of $50 is the present value of the expected payoff of the option. The expected payoff of the option is the maximum of either the stock price increasing by 20% or decreasing by 16.7%. 

Therefore, the expected payoff of the option is $50 + 0.2($50) = $60.

The present value of this expected payoff is $60/(1 + 0.127) = $56.83. 

Therefore, the value of the one-month call option with an exercise price of $50 is $56.83.

**b. What is the option delta?**

The delta of a call option is the rate of change of the option value with respect to the underlying stock price.

Since the call option has an exercise price of $50, the delta is the rate of change of the option value with respect to a change in the stock price from $50.

The delta of the one-month call option is 1 if the stock price increases by 20%, and 0.833 if the stock price decreases by 16.7%. The average of these two values is 0.917.

Therefore, the delta of the one-month call option is 0.917.

**c. Show how the payoffs of this call option can be replicated by buying P&G’s stock and borrowing.**

The payoffs of the one-month call option can be replicated by buying one share of P&G’s stock and borrowing an amount equal to the exercise price of the option.

If the stock price increases by 20%, the payoff of the option will be $60, and the payoff of the replicating portfolio will also be $60. 

If the stock price decreases by 16.7%, the payoff of the option will be 0, and the payoff of the replicating portfolio will also be 0. 

Therefore, the payoffs of the one-month call option can be replicated by buying one share of P&G’s stock and borrowing an amount equal to the exercise price of the option.

**d. What is the value of a two-month call option with an exercise price of $50?**

The value of a two-month call option with an exercise price of $50 is the present value of the expected payoff of the option. 

The expected payoff of the option is the maximum of either the stock price increasing by 40% (20% per month for two months) or decreasing by 33.3% (16.7% per month for two months). 

Therefore, the expected payoff of the option is $50 + 0.4($50) = $70.

The present value of this expected payoff is $70/(1 + 0.127)^2 = $62.29.

Therefore, the value of the two-month call option with an exercise price of $50 is $62.29.

**e. What is the option delta of the two-month call over the first one-month period?**

The delta of the two-month call over the first one-month period is the rate of change of the two-month option value with respect to a change in the stock price from the exercise price of the one-month option. 

The delta of the two-month call over the first one-month period is 1 if the stock price increases by 20%, and 0.667 if the stock price decreases by 16.7%. The average of these two values is 0.833.

Therefore, the delta of the two-month call over the first one-month period is 0.833.
