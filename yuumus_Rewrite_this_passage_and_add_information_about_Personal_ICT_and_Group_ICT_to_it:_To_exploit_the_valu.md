To exploit the value generated by the information infrastructure, an organisation needs to plan and manage the deployment and integration of its ICTs. To design, organise and maintain efficient and effective information infrastructures, managers need to understand the characteristics of the available systems. They also need to understand how different ICTs solutions work both as stand-alone systems and as part of the integrated information infrastructures that constitute the technological backbone of their organisation’s business activities.

When managing information infrastructures, it is essential to distinguish between **Personal ICT** and **Group ICT**. Personal ICT refers to the technology used by individuals to interact with each other and with the organisation, while Group ICT refers to the technology used by groups of individuals to interact with each other and with the organisation.

In addition, managers must consider the importance of **system integration**. Effective system integration ensures that all elements of the ICT system are working together to create a unified and effective information infrastructure. By integrating different ICTs, organisations can improve their efficiency, reduce costs and increase their ability to respond quickly to changes in their environment.

Furthermore, it is essential to understand the **impact of ICT on the organisation’s business activities**. ICT has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of the organisation by reducing costs and increasing the speed of delivery of services. However, it can also introduce risks, such as the potential for data breaches and security vulnerabilities. Managers must understand the risks associated with ICT and develop strategies to mitigate them.

Finally, managers must understand the **economic implications of ICT**. By understanding the costs and benefits associated with ICT, managers can better assess the potential return on investment from ICT and make more informed decisions about the deployment of ICT within the organisation.

In conclusion, to exploit the value generated by the information infrastructure, an organisation needs to plan and manage the deployment and integration of its ICTs, while understanding the characteristics of the available systems and the impact of ICT on the organisation’s business activities. Furthermore, managers must distinguish between Personal ICT and Group ICT, consider the importance of system integration, and understand the economic implications of ICT.
