### Underlying Assumptions of Arbitrage Pricing Theory

The Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) is a theory of asset pricing that states that the expected rate of return of a security is a linear function of various macroeconomic factors. The underlying assumptions of the APT are:

1. **Rational Investors:** Investors are assumed to be rational and have homogenous expectations.
2. **Well-Diversified Portfolios:** The well-diversified portfolio with non-systematic risk = 0 exists in the market.
3. **Market Imperfections:** The market is imperfect, and arbitrage opportunities exist.
4. **Factors Affecting Returns:** The stock's return depends on a range of macroeconomic factors.

**Statement Not Belonging to the Underlying Assumptions of APT:**

**C) The market perfect, competitive and does not offer any arbitrage opportunities**
