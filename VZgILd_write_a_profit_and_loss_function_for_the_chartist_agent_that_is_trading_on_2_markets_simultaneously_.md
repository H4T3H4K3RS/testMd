## Profit and Loss Function 

The profit and loss (P&L) function is an important component of an agent-based model of the stock market. It is used to determine the expected return of an agent's trading strategy and to assess the risk associated with it. In this section, we will discuss how to construct a P&L function for a chartist agent trading on two markets simultaneously.

### Construction of P&L Function 

Let $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ represent the two markets and $P^{M_{1}}_{t}, P^{M_{2}}_{t}$ the prices of the assets in each market at time $t$. The chartist agent's trading strategy is based on the assumption that the prices of the assets in each market will follow a wavelet transform. We will assume that the wavelet transform is a linear combination of wavelets, of which the coefficients are denoted by $\gamma$. The chartist agent's total profit or loss $P&L$ at time $t$ can then be written as:

$$P & L(t) = \gamma_{1} P^{M_{1}}_{t} + \gamma_{2} P^{M_{2}}_{t}.$$

This equation expresses the chartist agent's total profit or loss at time $t$ as the sum of the profits or losses from each market. The coefficients $\gamma_{1}$ and $\gamma_{2}$ depend on the particular wavelet transform the agent is using and can be estimated from the data.

The chartist agent's expected return $E(P&L)$ over a given period of time $T$ can then be written as:

$$E(P & L) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} P & L(t).$$

This equation expresses the chartist agent's expected return as the average of its total profits or losses over the period of time $T$.

Finally, the chartist agent's risk $R$ can be written as:

$$R = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (P & L(t) - E(P & L))^{2}}.$$

This equation expresses the chartist agent's risk as the standard deviation of its total profits or losses over the period of time $T$.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have discussed how to construct a P&L function for a chartist agent trading on two markets simultaneously. We have derived equations for the agent's total profit or loss, expected return, and risk. We have also reviewed related research on constructing profit and loss functions for agent-based models of the stock market.
