A Nash equilibrium is a strategy combination that is the best response for both players, such that neither player can improve their payoff by changing their strategy.

**Nash Equilibria:**

The Nash equilibria for this game are (Left, Left) and (Right, Right). 

**Explanation:**

For (Left, Left) to be a Nash equilibrium, Player 1 must receive the highest payoff when they choose Left regardless of what Player 2 chooses, and Player 2 must receive the highest payoff when they choose Left regardless of what Player 1 chooses. This is true, as Player 1 receives a payoff of 3 when they choose Left regardless of what Player 2 chooses, and Player 2 receives a payoff of 3 when they choose Left regardless of what Player 1 chooses. Thus, (Left, Left) is a Nash equilibrium.

For (Right, Right) to be a Nash equilibrium, Player 1 must receive the highest payoff when they choose Right regardless of what Player 2 chooses, and Player 2 must receive the highest payoff when they choose Right regardless of what Player 1 chooses. This is true, as Player 1 receives a payoff of 1 when they choose Right regardless of what Player 2 chooses, and Player 2 receives a payoff of 1 when they choose Right regardless of what Player 1 chooses. Thus, (Right, Right) is a Nash equilibrium.
