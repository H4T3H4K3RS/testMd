**a. Draw the payoff graph for this strategy at the option expiration date.**

The payoff graph for the given strategy would be a combination of the payoff graphs of the written call option (with X = 50) and the bought call option (with X = 60). 

The payoff graph of the written call option (with X = 50) will be as follows:

The payoff graph of the bought call option (with X = 60) will be as follows:

**b. Draw the profit graph for this strategy.**

The profit graph of the given strategy can be drawn by subtracting the costs of the written and bought call options from the combined payoff graph. 

The cost of written call option = 3
The cost of bought call option = 9

The profit graph of the given strategy will be as follows:

**c. What is the break-even point for this strategy? Is the investor bullish or bearish on the stock?**

The break-even point for this strategy is the price of the stock at which the investor does not incur any profit or loss from the given strategy. This can be calculated by adding the costs of the written and bought call options and then finding the price of the stock where the combined payoff graph crosses the sum of the costs. 

The cost of written call option = 3
The cost of bought call option = 9

The break-even point for this strategy is 53 (i.e., the stock price should be 53 at the expiration date of the options for the investor to break even). 

The investor is bullish on the stock since they are expecting the stock price to rise above the break-even point of 53.
