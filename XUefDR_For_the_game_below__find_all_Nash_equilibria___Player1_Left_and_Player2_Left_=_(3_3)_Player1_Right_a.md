## Nash Equilibria

A Nash equilibrium is a strategy combination where neither player has an incentive to unilaterally change their own strategy, given the other playerâ€™s strategy. 

Given the game below, we can find all Nash equilibria.

|Player 1   | Left | Right |
|-----------|------|-------|
|Player 2   | Left | Right |
|Payoffs    | (3,3)| (2,0)|
|           | (0,2)| (1,1)|

The Nash equilibria of the game above can be identified by looking at the payoff matrix. We can see that there are two Nash equilibria in this game: (Left, Left) and (Right, Right). This means that if both players choose Left or Right, then neither player has an incentive to change their strategy. 

Therefore, the Nash equilibria of the game above are:

$$(Left, Left) \quad \text{and} \quad (Right, Right)$$
