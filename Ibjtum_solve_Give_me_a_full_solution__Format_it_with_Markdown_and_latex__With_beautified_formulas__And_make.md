**Solution**

Let $x$ and $y$ be two numbers.

We have to find the product of $x$ and $y$.

$$\textbf{Solution:}$$

The product of $x$ and $y$ is given by:

$$xy = x \times y$$

Therefore,

$$xy = x \times y = (x)(y)$$

Therefore, the product of two numbers $x$ and $y$ is given by:

$$xy = (x)(y)$$
