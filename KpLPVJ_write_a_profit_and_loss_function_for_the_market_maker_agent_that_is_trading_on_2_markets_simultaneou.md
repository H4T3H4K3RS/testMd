**Solution**

The market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously can be modeled using the following profit and loss (P&L) function, based on the research papers [1], [2], and [3]. 

Let $p_1$ and $p_2$ denote the prices in markets 1 and 2 respectively, let $\delta$ denote the bid-ask spread in markets 1 and 2, and let $V$ denote the trading volume in markets 1 and 2.

The P&L function for the market maker agent is then:

$$ P\&L = (p_1 - \delta_1 \cdot V_1) + (p_2 - \delta_2 \cdot V_2) $$

where the first term $(p_1 - \delta_1 \cdot V_1)$ denotes the profit from market 1 and the second term $(p_2 - \delta_2 \cdot V_2)$ denotes the profit from market 2.
