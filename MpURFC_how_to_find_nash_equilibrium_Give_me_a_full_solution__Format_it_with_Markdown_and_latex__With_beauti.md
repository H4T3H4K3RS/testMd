In game theory, the Nash equilibrium is a solution concept of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only their own strategy.

The Nash Equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can gain by unilaterally changing their strategy.

## **Steps to Finding the Nash Equilibrium**

1. Construct the payoff matrix of the game.

2. Find the best response to each strategy by each player by solving the maximization problem.

3. If a strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium, then no player can gain by unilaterally changing their strategy.

4. Check if the best response of each player is the same as their strategy in the strategy profile. If yes, then the strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium.

## **Example**

Consider a game between two players, Alice and Bob, with the following payoff matrix:

|  | Alice | Bob |
|--|-------|-----|
| **Top** | (4, 1) | (2, 3) |
| **Bottom** | (3, 2) | (1, 4) |

Here, the numbers in the parentheses represent the payoffs for Alice and Bob respectively.

### **Step 1: Construct the Payoff Matrix**

The payoff matrix is already given above.

### **Step 2: Find the Best Response to Each Strategy**

Alice's best response to Bob's Top strategy is Bottom, as she gets a higher payoff (3) than when she plays Top (2).

Bob's best response to Alice's Top strategy is Top, as he gets a higher payoff (3) than when he plays Bottom (2).

Alice's best response to Bob's Bottom strategy is Top, as she gets a higher payoff (4) than when she plays Bottom (3).

Bob's best response to Alice's Bottom strategy is Bottom, as he gets a higher payoff (4) than when he plays Top (3).

### **Step 3: Check if the Strategy Profile is a Nash Equilibrium**

We have the following strategy profile: Alice plays Top and Bob plays Top.

Alice's best response to Bob's Top strategy is Bottom, and Bob's best response to Alice's Top strategy is Top. Therefore, the strategy profile is not a Nash equilibrium, as Alice has something to gain by unilaterally changing her strategy.

We have the following strategy profile: Alice plays Bottom and Bob plays Bottom.

Alice's best response to Bob's Bottom strategy is Top, and Bob's best response to Alice's Bottom strategy is Bottom. Therefore, the strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium, as neither player has anything to gain by unilaterally changing their strategy.
