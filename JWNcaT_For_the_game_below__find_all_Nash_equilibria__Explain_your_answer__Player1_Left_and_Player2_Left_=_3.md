**Nash Equilibria**

The Nash Equilibrium for the above game is (Left, Left) and (Right, Right). Both players have no incentive to deviate from the equilibrium, as both can do no better if they do.

**Explanation**

In order for a game to reach a Nash Equilibrium, both players must have no incentive to deviate from the equilibrium. In other words, both players must be in a situation where they cannot improve their outcome by changing their strategy. 

In the game described above, (Left, Left) and (Right, Right) are both Nash Equilibria. If Player 1 plays Left and Player 2 plays Left, they both get a payoff of 3. Similarly, if Player 1 plays Right and Player 2 plays Right, they both get a payoff of 3. In both cases, neither player can do better than 3 by deviating to a different strategy.

On the other hand, if Player 1 plays Left and Player 2 plays Right, Player 1 gets a payoff of 0 and Player 2 gets a payoff of 2. Similarly, if Player 1 plays Right and Player 2 plays Left, Player 1 gets a payoff of 2 and Player 2 gets a payoff of 0. In both cases, each player can do better by switching to the other strategy, so (Left, Right) and (Right, Left) are not Nash Equilibria.
