# **Solution**

A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies for each player in a game such that no player has an incentive to change their strategy given the strategies of the other players. 

In the game given, there are two players, Player1 and Player2, each with two strategies: Left and Right. The payoff matrix is given below:

| | Player2 \ Player1 | Left | Right |
| - | - | - | - |
| **Left** | (3,3) | (2,0) |
| **Right** | (0,2) | (1,1) |

The Nash equilibria of this game are:

## **(Left, Left)**

At this Nash equilibrium, both players have an incentive to remain with their current strategies. If Player1 chooses Left, then they will receive a payoff of 3, while if they choose Right, they will only receive a payoff of 2. Since 3 is greater than 2, Player1 has no incentive to deviate from their current strategy of Left. Similarly, if Player2 chooses Left, they will receive a payoff of 3, while if they choose Right, they will receive a payoff of 2. Since 3 is greater than 2, Player2 has no incentive to deviate from their current strategy of Left. Therefore, (Left, Left) is a Nash equilibrium of the game.

## **(Right, Right)**

At this Nash equilibrium, both players have an incentive to remain with their current strategies. If Player1 chooses Right, then they will receive a payoff of 1, while if they choose Left, they will only receive a payoff of 2. Since 1 is greater than 2, Player1 has no incentive to deviate from their current strategy of Right. Similarly, if Player2 chooses Right, they will receive a payoff of 1, while if they choose Left, they will receive a payoff of 2. Since 1 is greater than 2, Player2 has no incentive to deviate from their current strategy of Right. Therefore, (Right, Right) is a Nash equilibrium of the game.

# **Conclusion**

In conclusion, the game given has two Nash equilibria: (Left, Left) and (Right, Right).
