**Solution**

We can generate an undirected network that is as close as possible to the original real network by using the given statistics. The statistics provided are: 

* **Number of Nodes**: 1882
* **Radius**: [15, 2]
* **Diameter**: [28, 4]
* **Average Clustering**: [0.005066798238955518, 0.001]
* **Average Path Length**: [11.748410823170731, 2]
* **Number of Connected Components**: [168, 32]
* **Degree CDF**: [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 24, 46], [0.0, 0.6902231668437833, 0.8517534537725824, 0.9086078639744952, 0.9378320935175345, 0.9516471838469713, 0.9654622741764081, 0.9723698193411264, 0.9776833156216791, 0.9808714133900106, 0.9845908607863975, 0.9888416578108395, 0.9893730074388948, 0.9925611052072264, 0.9936238044633369, 0.9952178533475027, 0.9957492029755579, 0.9968119022316685, 0.997874601487779, 0.9989373007438895, 0.9994686503719448, 1.0]]

To generate a network that is closest to the original real network, we will first generate a graph with the desired number of nodes. We can use the networkx library for this purpose. 

```python
import networkx as nx

G = nx.Graph()
G.add_nodes_from(range(1882))
```

We will then set the radius, diameter, average clustering and average path length of the generated graph using the given statistics. We can use the ```nx.set_node_attributes``` method to set these values.

```python
radius = stats["radius"]
diameter = stats["diameter"]
clustering = stats["average_clustering"]
path_length = stats["average_path_length"]

nx.set_node_attributes(G, dict(zip(G.nodes(), radius)), "radius")
nx.set_node_attributes(G, dict(zip(G.nodes(), diameter)), "diameter")
nx.set_node_attributes(G, dict(zip(G.nodes(), clustering)), "clustering")
nx.set_node_attributes(G, dict(zip(G.nodes(), path_length)), "path_length")
```

We will then generate edges between the nodes in the graph based on the given degree CDF. The degree CDF is a list of degrees and probabilities which represents the probability of a node having that degree. We can use the ```nx.random_degree_sequence_graph``` method to generate a graph with the desired degree distribution.

```python
q_seq, p_seq = stats['degree_cdf']
G = nx.random_degree_sequence_graph(q_seq, p_seq)
```

The generated graph should be close to the original real network, as it has the same number of nodes, radius, diameter, average clustering, average path length, and degree distribution.
