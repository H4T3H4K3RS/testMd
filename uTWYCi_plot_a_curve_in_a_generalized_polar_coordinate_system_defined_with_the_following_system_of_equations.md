**Solution**

**Решение**

We will plot the curve in a generalized polar coordinate system defined by the following equations: 

$$r_o = 2 \mid \sin(2 \phi) \mid \quad \text{for}\quad 0 \leq \phi \leq 2\pi, \quad \Delta \phi = \frac{\pi}{4}$$

To plot the curve, we will first calculate the radius of the curve at each value of $\phi$. For this, we will substitute the values of $\phi$ in the equation for $r_o$: 

$$r_o \Big|_{\phi = 0} = 2 \mid \sin(2 \times 0) \mid = 0$$

$$r_o \Big|_{\phi = \frac{\pi}{4}} = 2 \mid \sin(2 \times \frac{\pi}{4}) \mid = \sqrt{2}$$

$$r_o \Big|_{\phi = \frac{\pi}{2}} = 2 \mid \sin(2 \times \frac{\pi}{2}) \mid = 2$$

$$r_o \Big|_{\phi = \frac{3\pi}{4}} = 2 \mid \sin(2 \times \frac{3\pi}{4}) \mid = \sqrt{2}$$

$$r_o \Big|_{\phi = \pi} = 2 \mid \sin(2 \times \pi) \mid = 0$$

We can now plot the curve using the above values of $r_o$ and $\phi$. The graph of the curve is shown below:
