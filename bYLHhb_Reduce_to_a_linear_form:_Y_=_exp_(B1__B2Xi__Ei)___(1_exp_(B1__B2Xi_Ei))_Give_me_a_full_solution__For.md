#### **Reducing to Linear Form** 

Recall the exponential form of the equation: 

$$Y = \frac{e^{(B_1 + B_2X_i +E_i)}}{1+e^{(B_1 + B_2X_i +E_i)}}$$

To reduce this equation to a linear form, we will use the following equation: 

$$\ln \left(\frac{Y}{1-Y}\right) = B_1 + B_2X_i +E_i$$

Now, we can use this equation to solve for Y, giving us the linear form of the equation: 

$$Y = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(B_1 + B_2X_i +E_i)}}$$
