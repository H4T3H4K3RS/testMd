**Solution:**

**Residual Demands:**
The residual demand of country 1 is given by:
$$R_1(P) = Q_1 - \frac{Y}{2} = Q_1 - \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}$$

Similarly, the residual demand of country 2 is given by:
$$R_2(P) = Q_2 - \frac{Y}{2} = Q_2 - \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}$$

**Marginal Revenues:**
The marginal revenue of country 1 is given by:
$$MR_1(P) = \frac{dR_1}{dy_1} = \frac{dQ_1 - \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}}{dy_1} = \frac{dQ_1}{dy_1} - \frac{1}{2}$$

Similarly, the marginal revenue of country 2 is given by:
$$MR_2(P) = \frac{dR_2}{dy_2} = \frac{dQ_2 - \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}}{dy_2} = \frac{dQ_2}{dy_2} - \frac{1}{2}$$

**Reaction Functions:**
The reaction function of country 1 is given by:
$$y_1^*(P) = \frac{1}{2}(30 - P - y_2)$$

Similarly, the reaction function of country 2 is given by:
$$y_2^*(P) = \frac{1}{2}(30 - P - y_1)$$

**Graph:**

The reaction curves for both countries are given below:
