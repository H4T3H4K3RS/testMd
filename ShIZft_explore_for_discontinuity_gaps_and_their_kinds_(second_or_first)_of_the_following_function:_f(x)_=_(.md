**Solution:**

The function f(x) = (2 * |x-1|)/(x^2-x^4) can be written as

$$f(x) = \frac{2 \lvert x-1 \rvert}{x^2 - x^4}$$

To determine the discontinuity gaps and their kinds (first or second) of this function, we need to consider the following cases:

**Case 1: x=1**

At x=1, the denominator is equal to zero and thus the function has a discontinuity gap. To determine the kind of the discontinuity gap, we need to calculate the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit at the point x=1.

$$\lim_{x \to 1^{-}} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 1^{-}} \frac{2 \lvert x-1 \rvert}{x^2 - x^4} = \frac{2}{2} = 1$$

$$\lim_{x \to 1^{+}} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 1^{+}} \frac{2 \lvert x-1 \rvert}{x^2 - x^4} = \frac{2}{2} = 1$$

As the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit at the point x=1 are both equal to 1, we can say that the discontinuity gap at x=1 is of the first kind.

**Case 2: x=0 and x=2**

At x=0 and x=2, the numerator is equal to zero and thus the function has a discontinuity gap. To determine the kind of the discontinuity gap, we need to calculate the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit at the points x=0 and x=2.

$$\lim_{x \to 0^{-}} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 0^{-}} \frac{2 \lvert x-1 \rvert}{x^2 - x^4} = \frac{2}{2} = 1$$

$$\lim_{x \to 0^{+}} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 0^{+}} \frac{2 \lvert x-1 \rvert}{x^2 - x^4} = \frac{2}{-2} = -1$$

$$\lim_{x \to 2^{-}} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 2^{-}} \frac{2 \lvert x-1 \rvert}{x^2 - x^4} = \frac{2}{-2} = -1$$

$$\lim_{x \to 2^{+}} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 2^{+}} \frac{2 \lvert x-1 \rvert}{x^2 - x^4} = \frac{2}{2} = 1$$

As the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit at the points x=0 and x=2 are not equal, we can say that the discontinuity gap at x=0 and x=2 is of the second kind.

**Conclusion:**

The function f(x) = (2 * |x-1|)/(x^2-x^4) has two discontinuity gaps at x=1, x=0 and x=2. The discontinuity gap at x=1 is of the first kind, while the discontinuity gaps at x=0 and x=2 are of the second kind.
