**(a) What are their residual demands? What are the marginal revenues? Find both countriesâ€™ reaction functions and draw a graph with reaction curves.**

The residual demand of country 1 is given by:

$$R_{1} = P(Q) - P(Q - y_{1}) = 30-Q + Q-y_{1} = 30-y_{1}$$

The residual demand of country 2 is given by:

$$R_{2} = P(Q) - P(Q - y_{2}) = 30-Q + Q-y_{2} = 30-y_{2}$$

The marginal revenues of country 1 and 2 are given by:

$$MR_{1} = \frac{\partial R_{1}}{\partial y_{1}} = -1$$

$$MR_{2} = \frac{\partial R_{2}}{\partial y_{2}} = -1$$

The reaction functions of country 1 and 2 are given by:

$$y_{1} = 30 - R_{1}$$

$$y_{2} = 30 - R_{2}$$

The reaction curves are given as follows:

**(b) Calculate the profit-maximizing output levels of both countries, the market output and the market price. How is this equilibrium result called in economic literature? Represent your findings graphically. Does this market outcome result in a market failure? Using your graph, explain why or why not.**

The profit-maximizing output level of country 1 is given by:

$$\max \pi_{1} = P(Q)y_{1} - TC(y_{1}) = (30-y_{1})y_{1} - 6y_{1} = 24y_{1} - 6y_{1} = 18y_{1}$$

Differentiating with respect to $y_1$ and setting it to zero, we get:

$$\frac{\partial \pi_{1}}{\partial y_{1}} = 18 - 6 = 12 = 0$$

Therefore, the profit-maximizing output level of country 1 is given by:

$$y_{1}^{*} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}$$

Similarly, the profit-maximizing output level of country 2 is given by:

$$y_{2}^{*} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}$$

The market output is given by:

$$Q^{*} = y_{1}^{*} + y_{2}^{*} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$$

The market price is given by:

$$P^{*} = P(Q^{*}) = 30 - Q^{*} = 30 - 1 = 29$$

This equilibrium result is called the Cournot equilibrium in economic literature.

The market outcome does not result in a market failure as the Cournot equilibrium results in an efficient allocation of resources. This can be seen from the graph below:

The Cournot equilibrium (Q*, P*) results in an efficient allocation of resources as it is the point at which the marginal cost and marginal revenue curves intersect.

**(c) Suppose that now both countries collude and maximize their joint prof- its. What is their joint marginal revenue? Calculate the resulting joint output level and the market price. Under the assumption that every member of the agreement produces exactly one half of the total output, evaluate whether this collusive agree- ment leads to higher profits for a country compared to the equilibrium in (b). Using your results from (a) and (c), discuss whether this collusive agreement is likely to be stable.**

The joint marginal revenue is given by:

$$MR = \frac{\partial R_{1} + \partial R_{2}}{\partial y_{1} + \partial y_{2}} = \frac{\partial (30 - y_{1} + 30 - y_{2})}{\partial (y_{1} + y_{2})} = -2$$

The resulting joint output level is given by:

$$Q^{**} = y_{1} + y_{2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$$

The market price is given by:

$$P^{**} = P(Q^{**}) = 30 - Q^{**} = 30 - 1 = 29$$

Under the assumption that every member of the agreement produces exactly one half of the total output, the profits of each country under the collusive agreement will be higher than the profits from the equilibrium in (b). This is because the collusive agreement results in a joint marginal revenue of -2, whereas the equilibrium in (b) resulted in a marginal revenue of -1 for each country.

This collusive agreement is likely to be stable as each country has an incentive to abide by it. If a country were to deviate from the agreement, it would not be able to capture the full joint marginal revenue of -2 and its profits would be lower than if it were to abide by the agreement.
