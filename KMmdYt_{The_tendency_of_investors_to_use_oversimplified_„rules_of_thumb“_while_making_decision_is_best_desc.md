**The Tendency of Investors to Use Oversimplified "Rules of Thumb" While Making Decisions is Best Described by Overconfidence Bias**

Overconfidence bias is the tendency for people to overestimate their ability to accurately predict future outcomes. People often make decisions without considering the full range of potential outcomes or the potential risks involved. This can lead to overconfidence in their decisions, which can lead to bad outcomes and losses.

In investing, overconfidence bias can manifest itself in a variety of ways, such as investors overestimating their ability to select stocks that will outperform the market, or making decisions based on limited information or past successes.

Overconfidence bias can also lead to excessive trading, which increases transaction costs, reduces portfolio diversification and increases the potential for losses.

It is important for investors to be aware of their own biases and to practice sound risk management when making investment decisions. This means taking the time to fully understand the potential risks and rewards of each investment decision and making decisions based on facts and data rather than emotions.
