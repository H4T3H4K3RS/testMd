| Player1 | Player2 | Left | Right |
| ------ | ------- | ---- | ----- |
| Left   | Left    | 3,3  | 2,0   |
| Right  | Left    | 0,2  | 1,1   |
| Left   | Right   | 2,0  | 1,1   |
| Right  | Right   | 0,2  | 3,3   |

A Nash equilibrium occurs when no player has an incentive to change their strategy given the strategies of the other players. The Nash equilibria for the game above are both of the following: 

1. (Left, Left) - Both players choose the Left option and receive a payoff of (3,3).

2. (Right, Right) - Both players choose the Right option and receive a payoff of (3,3).

This is because, if both players choose the Left option, they will receive a payoff of (3,3). If one player chooses the Left option and the other chooses the Right option, the player choosing the Left option will receive a payoff of (2,0) while the player choosing the Right option will receive a payoff of (0,2). If both players choose the Right option, they will receive a payoff of (1,1). In all cases, neither player has an incentive to change their strategy, so the two Nash equilibria are (Left, Left) and (Right, Right).
