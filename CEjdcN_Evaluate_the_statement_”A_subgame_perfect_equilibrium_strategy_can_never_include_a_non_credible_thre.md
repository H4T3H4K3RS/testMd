A subgame-perfect equilibrium strategy can include a non-credible threat. A non-credible threat is a threat made by a player in a game that the player has no intention of carrying out. In game theory, non-credible threats are sometimes used as a way to influence the outcome of a game.

A subgame-perfect equilibrium is an equilibrium strategy that takes into account the strategies of players in all subgames of a game. Subgames are a way of dividing a game into smaller, more manageable pieces. A subgame-perfect equilibrium is a strategy that takes into account the strategies of all players in all subgames.

A non-credible threat can be part of a subgame-perfect equilibrium strategy because it can be used by players to influence the outcome of a game. For example, a player may make a non-credible threat in order to convince the other players to cooperate with them. The non-credible threat may be enough to convince the other players to cooperate, and thus, the non-credible threat can be part of a subgame-perfect equilibrium strategy.

In conclusion, a subgame-perfect equilibrium strategy can include a non-credible threat. A non-credible threat can be used to influence the outcome of a game and can be part of a subgame-perfect equilibrium strategy.
