## **Calculating Option Delta**

Option Delta measures the rate of change in the price of a stock option relative to a change in the underlying stock's price.

The formula for option delta is:

$$\Delta = \frac{\partial C}{\partial S}$$

where $C$ is the option's call price and $S$ is the underlying stock's price.

In this case, we assume that the option's call price will increase by 20% if the underlying stock's price increases by 20%, and decrease by 16.7% if the underlying stock's price decreases by 16.7%.

Therefore, the option delta can be calculated as follows:

$$\Delta = \frac{0.2 \times 50 + 0.167 \times 50}{0.2 \times 50 - 0.167 \times 50} = 0.719$$

Therefore, the option delta is 0.719.
