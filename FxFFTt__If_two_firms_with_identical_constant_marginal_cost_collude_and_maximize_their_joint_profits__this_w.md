**Answer**:

This statement is **False**. When two firms with identical constant marginal costs collude and maximize their joint profits, the resulting allocation will be socially desirable, as long as the firms are profit-maximizing.

This is because, under conditions of perfect competition, the market equilibrium would result in the same output and price that the firms would choose when colluding. Therefore, any allocation that is socially desirable in a competitive market will remain socially desirable when the firms are colluding.

The two firms will maximize their joint profits by setting a price that is equal to their marginal cost, as this will result in a monopoly profit of

$$ \pi_m = P(Q)Q - \sum_{i=1}^{2} C_i(Q)Q  $$

where $P(Q)$ is the price, $Q$ is the quantity, and $C_i(Q)$ is the cost to firm $i$.

Therefore, the resulting price and quantity will be the same as in a competitive market, which is socially desirable.
