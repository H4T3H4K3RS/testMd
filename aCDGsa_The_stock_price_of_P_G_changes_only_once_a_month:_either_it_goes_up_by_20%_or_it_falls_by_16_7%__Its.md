**a. What is the value of a one-month call option with an exercise price of $50?**

The value of a one-month call option with an exercise price of $50 is the present value of the expected payoff of the option at expiration. The expected payoff is either 0 (if the stock price does not exceed the exercise price) or $50 (if the stock price rises by 20%) minus the exercise price of $50. Therefore, the value of the option is:

$$V_0 = e^{-rT} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot (50 - 50) \right) = 0$$

where $r$ is the interest rate and $T$ is the time to expiration.

**b. What is the option delta?**

The option delta is the sensitivity of the option value to changes in the underlying asset price. Since the option value is 0, the option delta is also 0.

**c. Show how the payoffs of this call option can be replicated by buying P&Gâ€™s stock and borrowing.**

The payoffs of the call option can be replicated by buying P&G's stock and borrowing an amount equal to the exercise price of the option. If at expiration the stock price rises by 20%, then the investor will have made a profit of $50 on the stock position, which will be offset by the repayment of the loan. If the stock price falls by 16.7%, then the investor will make a loss of $50 on the stock position, which will be offset by the repayment of the loan.

**d. What is the value of a two-month call option with an exercise price of $50?**

The value of the two-month call option is the present value of the expected payoff of the option at expiration. The expected payoff is either 0 (if the stock price does not exceed the exercise price) or $50 (if the stock price rises by 20%) minus the exercise price of $50. Therefore, the value of the option is:

$$V_0 = e^{-rT} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot (50 - 50) \right) = 0$$

where $r$ is the interest rate and $T$ is the time to expiration.

**e. What is the option delta of the two-month call over the first one-month period?**

The option delta of the two-month call over the first one-month period is the sensitivity of the option value to changes in the underlying asset price over that period. Since the option value is 0, the option delta over the first one-month period is also 0.
