Let $x$ and $y$ be the amounts of energy in each food item respectively. 

The total amount of energy from the two food items is given by 

$$E_{total} = x + y $$

The requirements for the energy content in the two food items are

1. $x \geq 430$ 
2. $y \geq 450$ 
3. $E_{total} \leq 930$

We can represent this information in a constraint system:

$$
\begin{align}
x & \geq 430 \\
y & \geq 450 \\
x + y & \leq 930
\end{align}
$$

The feasible region is given by the intersection of the three inequalities, and is a triangular region.

To maximize the total energy content, we will need to find the vertex of the triangle which has the largest $x + y$ value, i.e. the vertex $(930, 0)$. 

Therefore, the maximum total energy content is $930$.
