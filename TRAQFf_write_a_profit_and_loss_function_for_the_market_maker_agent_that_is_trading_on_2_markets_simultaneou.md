## Profit and Loss Function for Market Making Agent

The profit and loss (P&L) function for a market making agent trading in two markets simultaneously is a function of the prices $p_{1}, p_{2}$ of the two assets and the quantities of each asset $q_{1}, q_{2}$ traded by the agent. The P&L function is given by:

$$P\&L = q_{1}(p_{1} - p_{1}^{0}) + q_{2}(p_{2} - p_{2}^{0}) - \lambda (|q_{1}| + |q_{2}|)$$

where $p_{1}^{0}$ and $p_{2}^{0}$ are the prices of the two assets at the beginning of the trading period and $\lambda$ is a parameter used to capture the costs associated with trading.

This P&L function was first proposed by \cite{Takahashi2005} as a basic model of a market making agent in a double auction market.
