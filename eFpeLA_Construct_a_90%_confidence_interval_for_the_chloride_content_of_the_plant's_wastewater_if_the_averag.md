# **Solution**

Let $\mu$ be the mean of the chloride content of the plant's wastewater and $\sigma^2$ be the variance.

## **Calculating the 90% Confidence Interval**

The 90% confidence interval for the mean of the chloride content of the plant's wastewater is given by:

$$\bar{x} \pm 1.645 \sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2}{n}}$$

where, 
$\bar{x}$ is the sample mean,
$\sigma^2$ is the sample variance,
$n$ is the sample size.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$\bar{x} \pm 1.645 \sqrt{\frac{84}{20}}$$

$$\bar{x} \pm 10.609$$

Therefore, the 90% confidence interval for the mean of the chloride content of the plant's wastewater is given by:

$$(269.391, 290.609)$$
