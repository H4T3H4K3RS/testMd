## Nash Equilibrium 

A Nash equilibrium is a combination of strategies, one for each player, such that each player's strategy is the best response to the other player's strategy. In other words, given the strategies of the other players, no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their own strategy. 

A Nash equilibrium for the given game can be found by examining the strategies of each player.

### Player 1 Strategies 

* **Left:** If Player 1 chooses the left strategy, then Player 2's best response is to choose the left strategy, resulting in a payoff of (3,3) for both players. 
* **Right:** If Player 1 chooses the right strategy, then Player 2's best response is to choose the right strategy, resulting in a payoff of (1,1) for both players. 

### Player 2 Strategies 

* **Left:** If Player 2 chooses the left strategy, then Player 1's best response is to choose the left strategy, resulting in a payoff of (3,3) for both players. 
* **Right:** If Player 2 chooses the right strategy, then Player 1's best response is to choose the right strategy, resulting in a payoff of (1,1) for both players. 

### Nash Equilibrium 

The only Nash equilibrium for the given game is for both players to choose the strategies of left and right, resulting in a payoff of (1,1).

Mathematically, the Nash equilibrium can be expressed as follows:

$$\left(\textbf{Left}, \textbf{Right}\right) = \left(\frac{3+2+0+1}{4}, \frac{3+0+2+1}{4}\right) = \left(\frac{6}{4}, \frac{6}{4}\right) = \left(1.5, 1.5\right) = \left(1,1\right)$$
