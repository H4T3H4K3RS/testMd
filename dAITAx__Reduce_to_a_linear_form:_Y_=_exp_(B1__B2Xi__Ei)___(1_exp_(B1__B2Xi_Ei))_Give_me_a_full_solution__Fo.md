### Solution
The given equation can be reduced to a linear form by taking the natural logarithm of both sides, which yields the following linear equation:

$$\ln(Y) = \ln\left(\frac{exp (B1 +B2Xi +Ei)}{1+exp (B1 +B2Xi+Ei)}\right)$$

We can simplify the equation further by applying the following identity: 

$$\ln(a) - \ln(b) = \ln\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)$$

Substituting this identity in the above equation yields:

$$\ln\left(\frac{Y}{1-Y}\right) = \ln\left(exp (B1 +B2Xi +Ei)\right)$$

By applying the logarithm rules, we can further simplify the equation as follows:

$$\ln(Y) - \ln(1-Y) = B1 + B2Xi + Ei$$

Therefore, the equation can be reduced to a linear form:

$$Y = \frac{exp(B1 + B2Xi + Ei)}{1 + exp(B1 + B2Xi + Ei)}$$
