 

**Profit and Loss Function for Dragon Rider Agent:**

The Dragon Rider agent is a type of artificial agent used in agent-based stock market models. This agent is designed to emulate the strategy of a human trader, which involves making decisions based on the current market price and other market conditions. The agent is programmed to buy and sell stocks based on these conditions, and its objective is to maximize profits. 

The following is the profit and loss (P&L) function for the Dragon Rider agent, which is based on the research papers "Dynamic Programming of the Dragon Rider Agent in an Agent-Based Stock Market Model" by Zheng et al. (2020) and "Agent-Based Models of Stock Markets: A Survey" by Vazquez et al. (2020):

$$P&L=\sum_{i=1}^{N}(P_c-P_o)S_i+\sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ \left( \frac{P_c-P_o}{P_o} \right) F_i - \left( \frac{P_c-P_o}{P_c} \right) C_i\right]$$

where

* $N$ is the number of stocks owned by the Dragon Rider agent
* $P_c$ and $P_o$ are the current and opening prices of each stock, respectively
* $S_i$ is the number of shares owned of stock $i$
* $F_i$ and $C_i$ are the transaction fees for buying and selling stock $i$, respectively

This P&L function shows that the Dragon Rider agentâ€™s profits are based on the difference between the current and opening prices of the stocks it owns, as well as the transaction fees associated with buying and selling the stocks.
