## Solution 

The differential equation is given as: 

$$ y'' + y = 6 \sin2x $$

The complementary function of the differential equation is found by solving the homogeneous equation, which is obtained by setting the right hand side of the given equation to zero.

$$ y'' + y = 0 $$

The characteristic equation of the above homogeneous equation is given as: 

$$ r^2 + 1 = 0 $$

$$ r_1 = i,~ r_2 = -i $$

The complementary function for the given differential equation is given as:

$$ y_c = c_1 \cos x + c_2 \sin x $$

Therefore, the general solution for the given differential equation is given as: 

$$ y = c_1 \cos x + c_2 \sin x + 6 \sin2x $$
