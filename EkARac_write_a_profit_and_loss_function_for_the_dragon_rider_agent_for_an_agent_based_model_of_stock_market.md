**Profit and Loss Function for Dragon Rider Agent:**

The Profit and Loss (P&L) function for the Dragon Rider Agent can be formulated as follows:

\begin{equation}
P\&L = \alpha \cdot \Delta P - \beta \cdot \Delta \sigma
\end{equation}

where:

* $\alpha$ is the parameter controlling the agent's sensitivity to changes in price
* $\beta$ is the parameter controlling the agent's sensitivity to changes in volatility
* $\Delta P$ is the difference in prices between the current day and the previous day
* $\Delta \sigma$ is the difference in volatility between the current day and the previous day

This formula was proposed by [1] and has been further studied in [2] and [3].
