**Underlying Assumptions of Arbitrage Pricing Theory**

1. Market Efficiency: 
The markets are efficient, i.e., assets are correctly priced according to their risk profiles. This means that the expected return on any asset is determined by its level of risk.

2. Risk Factors: 
The expected return of an asset can be modeled as a linear function of a number of risk factors.

3. Arbitrage Opportunities: 
The absence of arbitrage opportunities implies that the expected return on any asset is equal to the weighted average of the expected return on the risk factors.

4. Capital Market Line (CML): 
The expected return of any asset lies on the Capital Market Line (CML). 

**Correct Statement**
The expected return of an asset can be modeled as a linear function of a number of risk factors.
