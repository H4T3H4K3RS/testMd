## Solution

To calculate the level of the factor risk premia that is consistent with the reported value for the factor beta and the expected return for the stock, we use the following equation:

$$E(R_i) = R_f + \beta \cdot RP$$

Where:
- $E(R_i)$ is the expected return on the stock 
- $R_f$ is the risk-free rate 
- $\beta$ is the sensitivity of the stock to the factor 
- $RP$ is the factor risk premia

Given:
- $E(R_i)$ = 13,1% 
- $\beta$ = 1,2 
- $R_f$ = 5.0%

We can solve for $RP$ as follows:

$$13.1\% = 5.0\% + 1.2 \cdot RP$$

$$RP = \frac{13.1\% - 5.0\%}{1.2} = 8.2\%$$

Therefore, the level of the factor risk premia that is consistent with the reported value for the factor beta and the expected return for the stock is 8.2%.
