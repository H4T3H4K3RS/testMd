 

**a)** 

The residual demands for both countries are given by:

\begin{align}
y_1 &= \frac{30 - y_2}{2} \\
y_2 &= \frac{30 - y_1}{2}
\end{align}

The marginal revenues for both countries are given by:

\begin{align}
MR_1 &= \frac{\partial P(Q)}{\partial y_1} = \frac{1}{2} \\
MR_2 &= \frac{\partial P(Q)}{\partial y_2} = \frac{1}{2}
\end{align}

The reaction functions for both countries can be found by solving their respective marginal revenue equations for $y_1$ and $y_2$:

\begin{align}
y_1 &= 30 - 2MR_1 \\
y_2 &= 30 - 2MR_2
\end{align}

The reaction curves for both countries are given by:

\begin{align}
y_1 &= 30 - 2y_2 \\
y_2 &= 30 - 2y_1
\end{align}

The reaction curves can be represented graphically as follows:

**b)**

The profit-maximizing output levels for both countries can be found by setting their respective marginal revenues equal to zero:

\begin{align}
MR_1 &= 0 \implies y_1 = 15 \\
MR_2 &= 0 \implies y_2 = 15
\end{align}

The market output is given by the sum of the output levels of both countries:

\begin{align}
Y = y_1 + y_2 = 30
\end{align}

The market price can be found by plugging in the market output into the inverse demand function:

\begin{align}
P(Q) = 30 - Y = 30 - 30 = 0
\end{align}

This market outcome is referred to as a Cournot-Nash equilibrium. The market outcome does not result in a market failure since both countries are making rational decisions based on their respective marginal revenues and the market price is equal to the marginal cost.

The Cournot-Nash equilibrium can be represented graphically as follows:

**c)**

The joint marginal revenue for the countries can be found by summing their respective marginal revenues:

\begin{align}
MR_{joint} = MR_1 + MR_2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1
\end{align}

The resulting joint output level is found by setting the joint marginal revenue equal to zero:

\begin{align}
MR_{joint} = 0 \implies Y = 30
\end{align}

The market price can be found by plugging in the joint output level into the inverse demand function:

\begin{align}
P(Q) = 30 - Y = 30 - 30 = 0
\end{align}

The profits for each country under the collusive agreement are equal to half of the joint profits since they each produce one half of the total output:

\begin{align}
\pi_1 = \pi_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times (30 - 6 \times 15) = 45
\end{align}

This is higher than the profits for each country under the Cournot-Nash equilibrium (30).

The collusive agreement is likely to be stable since there is no incentive for either country to deviate from the agreement since it maximizes their individual profits.
