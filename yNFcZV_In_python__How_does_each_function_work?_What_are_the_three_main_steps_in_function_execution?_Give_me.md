## Function Execution in Python

Function execution in Python involves three main steps: 

1. **Parsing**
2. **Compilation**
3. **Execution**

### Parsing 

Parsing is the process of examining a program's source code and transforming it into a data structure that can be understood by the computer. In Python, this is done with the help of a parser, which is a program that reads the source code and produces an abstract syntax tree (AST). The AST is then passed to the interpreter, which processes it and executes the code.

### Compilation

Compilation is the process of transforming the source code into a form that can be executed by the computer. In Python, this is done with the help of a compiler. The compiler reads the source code and produces a bytecode that can be executed by the interpreter.

### Execution 

The interpreter reads the bytecode and executes it. The interpreter is responsible for executing the instructions contained in the bytecode. It is also responsible for handling any errors that occur during execution.

The entire process from parsing the source code to executing it is known as the *execution cycle*.
