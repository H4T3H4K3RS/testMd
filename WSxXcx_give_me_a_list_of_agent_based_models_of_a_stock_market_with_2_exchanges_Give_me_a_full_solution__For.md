## Introduction
A stock market typically consists of two exchanges, namely the primary exchange and the secondary exchange. This article will explore the concept of agent based models of a stock market with two exchanges and explain how they are used in the context of stock trading.

## Agent Based Model
An agent based model is a type of computer simulation that models the behavior of agents (human or non-human) within a simulated environment. Agent-based models can be used to simulate market dynamics, allowing for the exploration of various scenarios and their outcomes.

## Stock Market Model
In the context of a stock market model, agents represent different types of market participants such as traders, brokers, and investors. The model is composed of the following components: 

- **Auctions:** Auctions are used to match buyers and sellers in the market. 
- **Order Books:** Order books contain the bid and ask prices for a stock as well as the quantity of available shares. 
- **Trading Rules:** Trading rules are used to define the behavior of agents in the market. They determine how agents place orders, how they respond to market movements, and when they exit the market. 

## Modeling the Primary Exchange
The primary exchange is the main market where stocks are traded. It is the most important part of the stock market model as it determines the prices of stocks and the direction of the market. 

The primary exchange is modeled by simulating the following components: 

- **Price Formation:** Price formation is the process of creating the price for a stock. This is typically done through an auction process, where buyers and sellers submit bids and offers. 
- **Order Book Dynamics:** Order book dynamics determine how orders are matched and filled. This includes the order type, order size, and order priority. 
- **Trading Rules:** Trading rules are used to define the behavior of agents in the market. They determine how agents place orders, how they respond to market movements, and when they exit the market. 

## Modeling the Secondary Exchange
The secondary exchange is the market where stocks are traded after the primary exchange. It is typically smaller and less liquid than the primary exchange, but it is still an important part of the stock market model. 

The secondary exchange is modeled by simulating the following components: 

- **Price Formation:** Price formation is the process of creating the price for a stock. This is typically done through an auction process, where buyers and sellers submit bids and offers. 
- **Order Book Dynamics:** Order book dynamics determine how orders are matched and filled. This includes the order type, order size, and order priority. 
- **Trading Rules:** Trading rules are used to define the behavior of agents in the market. They determine how agents place orders, how they respond to market movements, and when they exit the market. 

## Conclusion
Agent-based models of a stock market with two exchanges can be used to simulate market dynamics, allowing for the exploration of various scenarios and their outcomes. The primary exchange is the main market where stocks are traded and is modeled by simulating price formation, order book dynamics, and trading rules. The secondary exchange is the market where stocks are traded after the primary exchange and is modeled by simulating price formation, order book dynamics, and trading rules.
