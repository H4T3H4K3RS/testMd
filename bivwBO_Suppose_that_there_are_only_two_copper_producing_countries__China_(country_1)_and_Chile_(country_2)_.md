**a)** 

The residual demands are given by:

$R_1 = P(Q) - TC'(y_1) = 30 - 6y_1$

$R_2 = P(Q) - TC'(y_2) = 30 - 6y_2$

The marginal revenues are given by:

$MR_1 = P'(Q) - TC''(y_1) = -6$

$MR_2 = P'(Q) - TC''(y_2) = -6$

The reaction functions for each country are given by:

$R_1 = 24 - 6y_1$

$R_2 = 24 - 6y_2$

The graph with reaction curves is given below:

**b)**

The profit-maximizing output levels for each country are given by:

$y_1 = 4$ 

$y_2 = 4$

The market output is $Y = y_1 + y_2 = 8$.

The market price is $P = 30 - Y = 22$.

This equilibrium result is called Cournot-Nash equilibrium. The graph of the Cournot-Nash equilibrium is given below:

This market outcome does not result in a market failure. This is because each firm is producing the output level which maximizes their profits given the output level of the other firm. 

**c)**

The joint marginal revenue is given by:

$MR_{1,2} = P'(Q) - TC''(y_1) - TC''(y_2) = -12$

The resulting joint output level is $Y = 12$ and the market price is $P = 18$.

Under the assumption that each member of the agreement produces exactly one half of the total output, each country produces an output level of $y = 6$. This leads to higher profits for a country compared to the equilibrium in (b). 

This collusive agreement is likely to be stable as each country has an incentive to stick to the agreement as they are better-off than the Cournot-Nash equilibrium.
