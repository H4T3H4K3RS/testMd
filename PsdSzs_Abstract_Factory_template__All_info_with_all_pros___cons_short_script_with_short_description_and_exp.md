# Abstract Factory Template
Abstract Factory is an object-oriented design pattern that aims to provide a solution to the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that is to be created. Instead, a client can specify a general type of object, and a factory object that is responsible for creating objects of the specific type is used. The Abstract Factory design pattern is a creational design pattern that is used to provide a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme.

## Pros
* It isolates the creation of objects from the client code. This allows the client code to be decoupled from the specific classes of objects it needs to create.
* It provides a way to create objects that follow a certain theme or have certain properties in common.
* It allows for the creation of objects without having to modify or even know the exact class of the object being created.
* It can be used to create a family of related objects without having to specify their concrete classes.

## Cons
* It can make the code more complicated since it involves creating multiple factories and abstract classes.
* It can add to the overall complexity of the code since the client code must now deal with multiple objects instead of just one.
* It can lead to code that is more difficult to maintain since changes to one part of the code may affect other parts.

## Solution
The Abstract Factory design pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme. The common theme can be anything from a product line, to a set of related products, or even a family of related objects. The client code can then specify a general type of object, and the appropriate factory object will create the desired object. 

The Abstract Factory design pattern is an excellent way to create objects that have certain properties in common without having to specify their exact class. It also allows for the creation of a family of related objects without having to modify or even know the exact class of the object being created. This makes it easier to maintain the code since changes to one part of the code will not affect other parts.
