# Solution

The price of a two-year European put option on NatureGreen Inc. stock with a strike price $60 can be calculated using the binomial option pricing model. 

## Binomial Option Pricing Model

The binomial option pricing model is a method used to calculate the price of an option over time. It is based on a discrete-time model of the underlying asset's price movements. The model takes into account the fact that the asset's price can either increase or decrease from one period to the next. The binomial option pricing model can be used to calculate the value of an option at any point in time.

## Calculation

The price of the two-year European put option can be calculated using the binomial option pricing model. The parameters for the model are as follows:

* Current price of NatureGreen Inc. stock: $50 per share
* Strike price: $60
* Risk-free rate of interest: 3%
* Time to expiration: 2 years

The binomial option pricing model can be used to calculate the value of the option at each period. The following table illustrates the possible outcomes at each period:

| Period |  Pricing Model  |  Price of Asset  |  Payoff   |
|:-----:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------:|
|   1   |     Increase    |     $60.00      |  $0.00    |
|   1   |     Decrease    |     $45.00      |  $15.00   |
|   2   |     Increase    |     $72.00      |  $0.00    |
|   2   |     Decrease    |     $54.00      |  $6.00    |

The price of the option can be calculated using the following formula:

$$ V = e^{-rT} \times \left[ p \times V_u + (1-p) \times V_d \right] $$

where:

* $V$ is the value of the option
* $r$ is the risk-free rate of interest
* $T$ is the time to expiration
* $p$ is the probability of the asset's price increasing
* $V_u$ is the value of the option if the asset's price increases
* $V_d$ is the value of the option if the asset's price decreases

In this case, the probability of the asset's price increasing is 0.5 and the value of the option if the asset's price increases is 0. The value of the option if the asset's price decreases is the payoff of the option ($15.00 for Period 1 and $6.00 for Period 2). 

Plugging in the values into the formula, the price of the two-year European put option on NatureGreen Inc. stock with a strike price $60 is calculated as:

$$ V = e^{-0.03 \times 2} \times \left[ 0.5 \times 0 + (1-0.5) \times 15 \right] = 9.09 $$

Therefore, the price of the two-year European put option on NatureGreen Inc. stock with a strike price $60 is $9.09.
