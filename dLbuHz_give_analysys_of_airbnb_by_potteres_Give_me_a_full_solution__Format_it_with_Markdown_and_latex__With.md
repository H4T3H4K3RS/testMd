Potter's Model is a powerful tool used to analyze the impact of Airbnb and other short-term rental services on the housing market. This model takes into account the economic and social impacts of Airbnb on the housing market.

## **Overview of Potter's Model**

Potter's Model is a two-part analysis that looks at the impact of Airbnb on both the supply side and demand side of the housing market. On the supply side, the model looks at how Airbnb affects the number of available rental units in a given area. On the demand side, the model looks at how Airbnb affects the number of people looking to rent in a given area.

## **Supply Side Analysis**

On the supply side, Potter's Model looks at how Airbnb affects the number of available rental units in a given area. Specifically, it looks at how Airbnb affects the supply of rental units compared to the demand for rental units.

The model assumes that the number of rental units supplied by Airbnb is equal to the number of rental units demanded by Airbnb users. This means that if there is an increase in the number of rental units supplied by Airbnb, then there will be an equal decrease in the number of rental units demanded by traditional rental markets. 

The impact of Airbnb on the supply side is determined by two key factors: the number of rental units supplied by Airbnb and the competition between Airbnb and traditional rental markets. If the number of rental units supplied by Airbnb increases, then this will put downward pressure on rental prices in the area, as traditional rental markets will be forced to compete with Airbnb for tenants. 

## **Demand Side Analysis**

On the demand side, Potter's Model looks at how Airbnb affects the number of people looking to rent in a given area. Specifically, it looks at how Airbnb affects the demand for rental units compared to the number of rental units supplied by traditional rental markets.

The model assumes that the number of rental units demanded by Airbnb users is equal to the number of rental units supplied by traditional rental markets. This means that if there is an increase in the number of rental units demanded by Airbnb users, then there will be an equal decrease in the number of rental units supplied by traditional rental markets. 

The impact of Airbnb on the demand side is determined by two key factors: the number of rental units demanded by Airbnb users and the competition between Airbnb and traditional rental markets. If the number of rental units demanded by Airbnb users increases, then this will put upward pressure on rental prices in the area, as traditional rental markets will be forced to compete with Airbnb for tenants.

## **Conclusion**
