**Solution:**

The value of a one-month call option with an exercise price of $50 can be calculated using the Black-Scholes formula:

$$C = SN(d_1) - Ke^{-rT}N(d_2)$$

where

- $S$ is the current price of the underlying asset,
- $K$ is the exercise price,
- $r$ is the interest rate, 
- $T$ is the time to expiration, 
- $N(d_1)$ and $N(d_2)$ are the cumulative normal distributions of $d_1$ and $d_2$, respectively.

We can calculate $d_1$ and $d_2$ using the following equations:

$$d_1 = \frac{ln\left(\frac{S}{K}\right) + \left(r + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}}$$

$$d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{T}$$

where $\sigma$ is the volatility of the underlying asset.

**Given Values:**

- $S = 50$
- $K = 50$
- $r = 0.01$
- $T = 1$
- $\sigma = 0.2$

**Calculations:**

$d_1 = \frac{ln\left(\frac{50}{50}\right) + \left(0.01 + \frac{0.2^2}{2}\right)1}{0.2\sqrt{1}} = 0$

$d_2 = 0 - 0.2\sqrt{1} = -0.2$

$N(d_1) = N(0) = 0.5$

$N(d_2) = N(-0.2) = 0.4207$

**Solution:**

Therefore, the value of the one-month call option with an exercise price of $50 is:

$$C = 50 \times 0.5 - 50e^{-0.01 \times 1} \times 0.4207 = 25 - 20.5143 = 4.4857$$
