**Solution:**

**Residual Demand:**
The residual demand for copper in each country is given by: 

$r_1(P) = P(Q) - P(y_2)$

$r_2(P) = P(Q) - P(y_1)$

**Marginal Revenue:** 
The marginal revenue of each country is given by:

$MR_1(P) = \frac{dP(Q)}{dy_1} = -1$

$MR_2(P) = \frac{dP(Q)}{dy_2} = -1$

**Reaction Functions:** 
The reaction function for each country is given by: 

$y_1 = \frac{MR_1(P)}{TC'(y_1)}$

$y_2 = \frac{MR_2(P)}{TC'(y_2)}$

$y_1 = \frac{-1}{6} \Rightarrow  y_1 = -\frac{1}{6}$

$y_2 = \frac{-1}{6} \Rightarrow  y_2 = -\frac{1}{6}$

**Graph:**

The reaction curves for both countries can be represented by the graph below:
