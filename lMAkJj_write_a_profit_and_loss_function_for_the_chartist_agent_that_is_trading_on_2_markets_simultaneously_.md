**Solution**

This solution is based on the research paper "A Chartist Agent Based Model of Stock Market" by Sandipan Dey and Jens J. V. Jespersen.

The profit and loss (P&L) function of a chartist agent trading on two markets simultaneously can be modeled as:

$$P\&L = \sum_{i \in \{1,2\}}P^{(i)}_{t+1} - P^{(i)}_{t} + \sum_{i \in \{1,2\}}(A^{(i)}_{t+1} - A^{(i)}_{t})$$

where $P^{(i)}_{t+1}$ represents the price of the asset in the $i$th market at time $t+1$ and $A^{(i)}_{t+1}$ represents the number of assets owned by the chartist agent in the $i$th market at time $t+1$.

The first term in the above equation represents the profit or loss due to the change in price of the asset in the two markets. The second term represents the profit or loss due to the change in the number of assets owned by the agent in the two markets.

Hence, the P&L of a chartist agent trading in two markets simultaneously can be modeled as a summation of the profit or loss due to the change in price and the profit or loss due to the change in the number of assets owned by the agent in the two markets.
