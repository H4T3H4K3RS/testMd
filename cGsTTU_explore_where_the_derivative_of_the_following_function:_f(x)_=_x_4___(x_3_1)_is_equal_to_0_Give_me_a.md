The derivative of a function $f(x)$ is given by:
$$f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}f(x)$$

In order to find the derivative of the given function, we will use the power rule: 
$$\frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1}$$

So, the derivative of $f(x)$ is given by:
$$f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{x^4}{x^3-1}\right)$$

Using the power rule and the quotient rule, we obtain:

$$f'(x) = \frac{(x^3-1)(4x^3)+ (x^4)(3x^2)}{(x^3-1)^2}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$f'(x) = \frac{4x^6+3x^6-4x^4}{(x^3-1)^2}$$

$$f'(x) = \frac{7x^6-4x^4}{(x^3-1)^2}$$

## **Finding Where the Derivative is Equal to 0**

In order to find the values of $x$ where the derivative of $f(x)$ is equal to 0, we will set the numerator of the fraction equal to 0, and then solve for $x$:

$$7x^6-4x^4 = 0$$

$$7x^4(x^2-\frac{4}{7}) = 0$$

From here, we have two cases: either $x^2-\frac{4}{7}=0$ or $x=0$.

$$x^2 = \frac{4}{7}$$

$$x = \pm\sqrt{\frac{4}{7}}$$

Therefore, the values of x where the derivative of $f(x)$ is equal to 0 are $x = \pm\sqrt{\frac{4}{7}}$ and $x=0$.
