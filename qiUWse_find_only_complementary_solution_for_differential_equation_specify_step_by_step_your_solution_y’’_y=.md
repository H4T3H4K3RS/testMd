## **Solution:**

The given differential equation is:

$$y'' + y = 6 \sin 2x$$

## **Step 1:**

To find the complementary solution of the differential equation, we will first solve the homogeneous equation. The homogeneous equation is:

$$y'' + y = 0$$

## **Step 2:**

To solve the homogeneous equation, we will use the characteristic equation, which is:

$$r^2 + 1 = 0$$

## **Step 3:**

The characteristic equation has two roots, which are:

$$r = \pm i$$

## **Step 4:**

The complementary solution is then given by:

$$y_c = c_1 \cos x + c_2 \sin x$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary constants.

## **Step 5:**

The general solution is then given by the sum of the complementary solution and the particular solution:

$$y = y_c + y_p$$

where $y_p$ is the particular solution.
