**Solution**

The residual demand for country 1 is given by:

$$R_1(y_2) = P(y_1 + y_2) - TC(y_1) = 30 -y_1 -y_2 - 6y_1 = 24 - 7y_1 - y_2$$

Similarly, the residual demand for country 2 is given by:

$$R_2(y_1) = P(y_1 + y_2) - TC(y_2) = 30 -y_1 -y_2 - 6y_2 = 24 - y_1 - 7y_2$$

The marginal revenues for country 1 and country 2 are given by:

$$\frac{dR_1}{dy_1} = -7 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{dR_2}{dy_2} = -7$$

From the residual demands and marginal revenues, the reaction functions for country 1 and country 2 are given by:

$$y_1 = \frac{1}{7} R_1(y_2) + y_2$$
$$y_2 = \frac{1}{7} R_2(y_1) + y_1$$

The reaction curves are shown in the graph below:
