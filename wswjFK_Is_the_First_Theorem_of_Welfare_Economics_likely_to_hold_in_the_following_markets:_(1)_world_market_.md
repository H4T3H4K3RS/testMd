## The First Theorem of Welfare Economics
The First Theorem of Welfare Economics states that under certain conditions, a competitive market equilibrium is Pareto efficient. This means that it is not possible to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off.

## World Market for Soybeans
The First Theorem of Welfare Economics is likely to hold in the world market for soybeans. This is because the market for soybeans is highly competitive, with producers in many different countries competing to provide soybeans to consumers. As such, the market is likely to reach an efficient equilibrium in which it is not possible to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off.

## World Market for Tablets
The First Theorem of Welfare Economics is less likely to hold in the world market for tablets. This is because the market for tablets is less competitive than that of soybeans, with only a handful of large companies producing tablets. As such, it is more likely that the market will not reach an efficient equilibrium in which it is not possible to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off.
