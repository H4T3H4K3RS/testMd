## Solution:

A profit and loss (P&L) function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously can be written as follows:

### P&L Function:

The P&L function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously is given by:

$$P\&L=\sum_{i=1}^{2} \big[ (V_{i}^{bid}-V_{i}^{ask})*B_{i} + (S_{i}^{bid}-S_{i}^{ask})*A_{i}\big]$$

Where:

- $V_{i}^{bid}$ and $V_{i}^{ask}$ are the bid and ask prices of the $i^{th}$ asset in the market
- $B_{i}$ is the number of shares bought in the $i^{th}$ market
- $S_{i}^{bid}$ and $S_{i}^{ask}$ are the bid and ask prices of the $i^{th}$ asset in the market
- $A_{i}$ is the number of shares sold in the $i^{th}$ market.
