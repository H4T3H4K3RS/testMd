In addition to the information systems management issues related to ICT outsourcing, it is also important to consider other aspects of information systems management that would provide a better understanding of the complexity associated with managing information systems in real-life cases. One such aspect is **project management**, which is critical in ensuring that ICT outsourcing projects are effectively planned, executed, and controlled to achieve their objectives. The success of the outsourcing project depends on the project manager's ability to communicate effectively with the vendor, manage risks, and deliver the project on time and within budget.

Another aspect to consider is **ICT governance**, which involves managing the alignment of ICT strategies with the overall business strategies of an organization. Effective ICT governance ensures that ICT investments are aligned with business objectives, risks are managed appropriately, and performance is monitored and measured to ensure that ICT outsourcing is providing the intended value to the organization. ICT governance also ensures that the outsourcing arrangement complies with legal and regulatory requirements, including data protection and privacy regulations.

In the case of the Cambridge University NHS Foundation Trust and Epic, a focus on project management and ICT governance may have helped to mitigate the issues that arose during the implementation of the online patient record system. For instance, effective project management would have ensured that the project was well-planned and executed, with clear communication between the trust and Epic, and a thorough risk management plan in place to identify and address potential issues. Effective ICT governance would have ensured that the outsourcing arrangement with Epic was aligned with the business objectives of the trust, with appropriate monitoring and measurement to ensure that the project was providing value and complying with legal and regulatory requirements.

In conclusion, a critical reflection on ICT outsourcing must consider not only the information systems management issues related to outsourcing, but also other aspects of information systems management such as project management and ICT governance. Understanding the complexity associated with managing information systems in real-life cases requires a comprehensive and holistic approach that takes into account all relevant aspects of information systems management.
