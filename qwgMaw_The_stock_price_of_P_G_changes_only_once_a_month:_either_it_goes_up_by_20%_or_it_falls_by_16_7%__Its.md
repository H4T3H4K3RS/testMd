**a. What is the value of a one-month call option with an exercise price of $50?**

The value of a call option with an exercise price of $50 and a one-month time horizon is equal to the present value of the expected payoff of the option. The expected payoff of the option is calculated as follows: 

$Expected \ Payoff = 0.2 * 50 + 0.833 * 50 = 58.33$ 

The present value of the expected payoff is discounted using the interest rate of 1% per month, which gives: 

$PV (Expected \ Payoff) = 58.33 / (1 + 0.01) = 57.71$ 

Therefore, the value of the one-month call option with an exercise price of $50 is $57.71.

**b. What is the option delta?**

The option delta is a measure of the sensitivity of the option price to a change in the price of the underlying asset. The option delta for a call option with an exercise price of $50 and a one-month time horizon is equal to the probability that the price of the underlying asset will be above the exercise price at expiration. In this case, the probability is 0.8333 (as the stock price could either go up by 20% or down by 16.7%). Therefore, the option delta is 0.8333.

**c. Show how the payoffs of this call option can be replicated by buying P&Gâ€™s stock and borrowing.**

The payoffs of a call option can be replicated by buying the underlying asset and borrowing a certain amount of money. The amount of money borrowed should be equal to the present value of the expected payoff of the option. In this case, the present value of the expected payoff of the option is $57.71. Therefore, to replicate the payoff of the call option, one should buy $50 worth of P&G stock and borrow $57.71.

**d. What is the value of a two-month call option with an exercise price of $50?**

The value of a two-month call option with an exercise price of $50 is equal to the present value of the expected payoff of the option. The expected payoff of the option is calculated as follows: 

$Expected \ Payoff = 0.2 * (50 * 1.2) + 0.833 * (50 * 0.833) = 63.5$ 

The present value of the expected payoff is discounted using the interest rate of 1% per month, which gives: 

$PV (Expected \ Payoff) = 63.5 / (1 + 0.01)^2 = 61.97$ 

Therefore, the value of the two-month call option with an exercise price of $50 is $61.97.

**e. What is the option delta of the two-month call over the first one-month period?**

The option delta of the two-month call option over the first one-month period is equal to the change in the option price divided by the change in the price of the underlying asset. In this case, the change in the option price is $3.26 (the value of the two-month call option is $61.97 and the value of the one-month call option is $58.71). The change in the price of the underlying asset is $10 (the stock price can either go up by 20% or down by 16.7%). Therefore, the option delta of the two-month call over the first one-month period is 0.326.
