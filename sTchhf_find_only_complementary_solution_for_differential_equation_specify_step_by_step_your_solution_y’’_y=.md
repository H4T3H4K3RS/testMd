**Solution**

We need to solve the differential equation given by:

$y'' + y = 6 \sin 2x$

We can rewrite this equation in the following form:

$r^2 + 1 = 6 \sin 2x$

We can now solve this equation using the characteristic equation:

$r^2 + 1 = 0$

Solving this equation, we get the solution $r = \pm i$.

Therefore, the general solution of the differential equation is given by:

$y = c_1 \cos x + c_2 \sin x + A \cos 2x + B \sin 2x$

Where $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined.

To determine the constants $A$ and $B$, we will substitute the general solution into the original differential equation and solve the resulting equation.

Substituting the general solution into the original equation, we get:

$-c_1 \sin x - c_2 \cos x + 2A \sin 2x + 2B \cos 2x = 6 \sin 2x$

Equating the coefficients of $\sin x$, $\cos x$, $\sin 2x$, and $\cos 2x$ on both sides of the equation, we get:

$-c_1 = 0$

$-c_2 = 0$

$2A = 6$

$2B = 0$

Therefore, we have $A = 3$ and $B = 0$.

Thus, the required solution is given by:

$y = c_1 \cos x + c_2 \sin x + 3 \cos 2x$
