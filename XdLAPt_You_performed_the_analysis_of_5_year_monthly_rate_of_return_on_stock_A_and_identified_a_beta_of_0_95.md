To calculate the abnormal rate of return for stock A, we need to use the following formula:

$$AR = R_{stock} - (R_{market} \times \beta)$$

Where: 
* $AR$ is the abnormal rate of return 
* $R_{stock}$ is the return of stock A 
* $R_{market}$ is the return of the market 
* $\beta$ is the beta of stock A 

In this case, we have the following values:

* $R_{stock} = 12\%$ 
* $R_{market} = 10\%$ 
* $\beta = 0.95$ 

Therefore, the abnormal rate of return for stock A is calculated as follows:

$$AR = 12\% - (10\% \times 0.95) = 1.5\%$$

Therefore, the abnormal rate of return for stock A is 1.5%.
