# Outsourcing is Bad
### Reasons 
1. Quality issues: One of the biggest cons of outsourcing is the potential for quality issues with the product or service you are receiving. Since the work is done remotely, it can be difficult to ensure that the same quality standards you require are met. 
2. Loss of control: When you outsource, you are giving up control of the project to the vendor. This can lead to delays, miscommunications, and other issues that can affect the outcome of the project. 
3. High costs: Outsourcing can be expensive, especially if you are working with an offshore vendor. Additionally, there may be hidden costs associated with the project that can add up quickly. 
4. Risk of data theft: If you are outsourcing sensitive data, there is a risk that it could be stolen or misused by the vendor. This can be a huge problem for businesses and could lead to a loss of customers and reputation. 

### Solution 
1. **Do your research**: Before you commit to outsourcing, you should do your due diligence and make sure that the vendor is reputable and reliable. 
2. **Set clear expectations**: It is important to set clear expectations with the vendor at the beginning of the project. This will help ensure that the project stays on track and that the quality standards you require are met. 
3. **Monitor progress**: It is important to monitor the progress of the project on a regular basis. This will help you ensure that the project is on track and that any issues are addressed quickly. 
4. **Have a backup plan**: It is important to have a backup plan in place in case there is an issue with the vendor. This will help protect you from any potential losses. 
5. **Keep data secure**: If you are outsourcing sensitive data, it is important to ensure that it is kept secure. Make sure that the vendor has the necessary security measures in place to protect your data. 

Overall, outsourcing can be beneficial for businesses, but it is important to be aware of the potential risks. By doing your research, setting clear expectations, monitoring progress, having a backup plan, and keeping data secure, you can ensure that your project is successful.
