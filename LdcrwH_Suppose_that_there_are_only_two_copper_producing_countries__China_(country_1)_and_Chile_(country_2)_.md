**a)**

The residual demand for country 1 is given by $R_1(y_1) = P(y_1 + y_2) - TC_1(y_1) = 30 - (y_1 + y_2) - 6y_1$ and the residual demand for country 2 is given by $R_2(y_2) = P(y_1 + y_2) - TC_2(y_2) = 30 - (y_1 + y_2) - 6y_2$.

The marginal revenues for both countries are given by $MR_1(y_1) = \frac{dR_1}{dy_1} = -7$ and $MR_2(y_2) = \frac{dR_2}{dy_2} = -7$.

The reaction curves for both countries are given by $y_1 = 7 + MR_1$ and $y_2 = 7 + MR_2$.

The graph with reaction curves is shown below:

**b)**

The profit-maximizing output levels for both countries are $y_1^* = 7$ and $y_2^* = 7$, the market output is $Y^* = y_1^* + y_2^* = 14$ and the market price is $P^* = 30 - Y^* = 16$. This equilibrium result is known as Cournot equilibrium in economic literature.

This market outcome does not result in a market failure as the price is equal to the marginal cost and the quantity is efficient.

**c)**

The joint marginal revenue for both countries is given by $MR_{joint} = \frac{dR_{joint}}{dY} = -1$.

The resulting joint output level is $Y^{joint} = 15$ and the market price is $P^{joint} = 30 - Y^{joint} = 15$.

It can be seen that the collusive agreement leads to higher profits for a country compared to the equilibrium in (b) as the price is higher and the quantity is higher.

This collusive agreement is likely to be stable as both countries have an incentive to maintain the agreement as it is beneficial for both countries.
