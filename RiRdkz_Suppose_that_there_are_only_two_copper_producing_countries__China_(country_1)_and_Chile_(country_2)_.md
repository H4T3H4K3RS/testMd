**a) Residual Demand & Marginal Revenues**

The residual demand for country 1 is given by: 

$$D_1=P(Q)-P(Q-y_1)=30-y_1-y_2-y_1=30-2y_1-y_2$$

The residual demand for country 2 is given by: 

$$D_2=P(Q)-P(Q-y_2)=30-y_1-y_2-y_2=30-y_1-2y_2$$

The marginal revenues for country 1 is given by: 

$$MR_1=-\frac{dD_1}{dy_1}=-2$$

The marginal revenues for country 2 is given by: 

$$MR_2=-\frac{dD_2}{dy_2}=-2$$

**Reaction Curves**

The reaction curves for country 1 and country 2 can be found by equating the marginal revenues to marginal costs, which are both equal to 6.

The reaction curve for country 1 is given by: 

$$MR_1=-2=MC_1=6 \implies y_1=4$$

The reaction curve for country 2 is given by: 

$$MR_2=-2=MC_2=6 \implies y_2=4$$

Therefore, the reaction curves for both countries are the same, given by $y_1=y_2=4$.

The reaction curves are shown in the graph below:
