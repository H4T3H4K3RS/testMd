1. **_Project Initiation_**
   
   Project initiation is the stage of the project where a project is defined and the project objectives and deliverables are identified. It includes the identification of stakeholders and the definition of the project scope, timeline, and budget.

2. **_Project Planning_** 

   Project planning is the stage of the project where the project plan is developed and the activities and tasks required to complete the project are identified, planned, and scheduled. It includes the definition of the project team, the development of the project schedule and budget, and the identification of the project risks.

3. **_Project Execution_** 

   Project execution is the stage of the project where the activities and tasks identified in the project plan are executed. It involves the coordination of the project resources and the implementation of the project activities and tasks.

4. **_Project Monitoring and Control_**

5. **_Project Change Management_**

   Project change management is the stage of the project where changes to the project plan are identified, analyzed, and approved. It involves the evaluation of changes to the project and the implementation of any necessary adjustments or modifications.

6. **_Project Risk Management_**

   Project risk management is the stage of the project where potential risks to the project are identified, analyzed, and managed. It involves the assessment of potential risks and the implementation of mitigation strategies to reduce the likelihood of those risks occurring.
