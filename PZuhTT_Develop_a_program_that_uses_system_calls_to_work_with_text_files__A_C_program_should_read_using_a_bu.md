# **Solution for Developing a Program using System Calls to Work with Text Files**

System calls are an important feature of an operating system, which provides an interface for user-level programs to interact with kernel-level services. In this program, system calls such as open, read, and write will be used to work with text files. The program should read the contents of the file using a buffer larger than the readable files and write the read file to a file with a different name. The file names to read and write should be specified using command line arguments. 

The following pseudocode outlines the steps to be taken to achieve this solution:

**Step 1:**
Check command line arguments
* If command line arguments are not provided, display error

**Step 2:**
Open the Read File
* Use open system call to open the read file 
* Store the file descriptor for the read file

**Step 3:**
Create a new Write File
* Use creat system call to create the write file 
* Store the file descriptor for the write file

**Step 4:**
Read from the Read File
* Use read system call to read from the read file 
* Store the data in a buffer that is larger than the readable files

**Step 5:**
Write to the Write File
* Use write system call to write to the write file 
* Write the data from the buffer to the write file

**Step 6:**
Close the Read File and Write File
* Use close system call to close the read and write files 

The following is the C code implementing the above algorithm: 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    int read_fd, write_fd;
    char buffer[1024];        // Buffer to store read data
    ssize_t nread;            // Number of bytes read from the read file
    ssize_t nwritten;         // Number of bytes written to the write file

    // Check command line arguments
    if (argc != 3)
    {
        printf("Error: Wrong number of arguments\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Open the Read File
    read_fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
    if (read_fd == -1)
    {
        printf("Error: Failed to open file\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Create the Write File
    write_fd = creat(argv[2], 0644);
    if (write_fd == -1)
    {
        printf("Error: Failed to create file\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Read from the Read File
    nread = read(read_fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    if (nread == -1)
    {
        printf("Error: Failed to read from file\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Write to the Write File
    nwritten = write(write_fd, buffer, nread);
    if (nwritten == -1)
    {
        printf("Error: Failed to write to file\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Close the Read and Write Files
    if (close(read_fd) == -1)
    {
        printf("Error: Failed to close the read file\n");
        return -1;
    }
    if (close(write_fd) == -1)
    {
        printf("Error: Failed to close the write file\n");
        return -1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The program takes two command line arguments: the name of the read file and the name of the write file. The program then uses the open system call to open the read file and store its file descriptor. The creat system call is then used to create the write file and store its file descriptor. The read system call is used to read from the read file and store the data in a buffer larger than the readable files. The write system call is used to write the data from the buffer to the write file. Finally, the close system call is used to close the read and write files. 

This program provides a solution for working with text files using system calls. The program reads the contents of the file using a buffer larger than the readable files and writes the read file to a file with a different name. The file names to read and write are specified using command line arguments.
