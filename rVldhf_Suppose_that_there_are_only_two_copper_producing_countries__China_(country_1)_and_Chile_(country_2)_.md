In order to calculate the profit-maximizing output levels for both countries, we must first determine the total cost functions for both countries. For China (country 1), the total cost function is 

$$TC(y_1) = 6y_1$$

and for Chile (country 2), the total cost function is 

$$TC(y_2) = 6y_2$$

We can then use these cost functions and the inverse demand function to determine the profit-maximizing output levels for both countries. The inverse demand function is given as 

$$P(Q) = 30 - Q$$

where $Q$ is the total quantity of copper produced by both countries. The profit for each country is then given by 

$$\pi_1 = P(Q) \cdot y_1 - TC(y_1)$$

and 

$$\pi_2 = P(Q) \cdot y_2 - TC(y_2)$$

To maximize the profit for each country, we need to set the derivatives of each of these equations to $0$ and solve for the corresponding output level. 

For China (country 1): 

$$\frac{\partial \pi_1}{\partial y_1} = P(Q) - 6 = 0 \implies Q = 6 \implies y_1 = 3$$

For Chile (country 2): 

$$\frac{\partial \pi_2}{\partial y_2} = P(Q) - 6 = 0 \implies Q = 6 \implies y_2 = 3$$

Therefore, the profit-maximizing output levels for both countries are both $3$ tons. The total market output is then given by $Q = y_1 + y_2 = 6$ tons, and the market price is $30 - 6 = 24$ thousand dollars. 

This market outcome is known as a Cournot equilibrium in economic literature. The Cournot equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium in which each firm produces the quantity of output that maximizes its profit given the output of the other firm. Graphically, this can be represented as follows:

In this graph, the demand curve (in blue) is given by $P(Q) = 30 - Q$ and the total cost curves (in red and orange) are given by $TC(y_1) = 6y_1$ and $TC(y_2) = 6y_2$. The intersection of the demand curve and the total cost curves gives us the optimal output levels for both countries ($y_1 = 3$ and $y_2 = 3$). 

This market outcome does not result in a market failure. The Cournot equilibrium is a market-clearing outcome in which the total quantity supplied is equal to the total quantity demanded. Therefore, the market is operating efficiently and there is no deadweight loss.
