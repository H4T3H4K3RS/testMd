a.European call and put option prices

The price of a European call option with a strike price of $220 and a six-month maturity is $14.67. The price of a European put option with a strike price of $220 and a six-month maturity is $15.66. 

b.Put-Call Parity

Put-call parity states that the price of a put option with a given strike price and maturity should be equal to the price of a call option with the same strike price and maturity plus the present value of the strike price. Thus, we can verify put-call parity by computing the present value of the strike price and checking that it equals the difference between the call and put prices:

$$15.66 - 14.67 = \frac{220}{(1+0.02)^{0.5}} \approx 15.56$$

Since the difference between the call and put prices is equal to the present value of the strike price, put-call parity holds for these options.

c.At-the-Money Straddle Payoff Function

The payoff function for an at-the-money straddle on XPZ is shown below:

In this graph, the x-axis represents the price of the XPZ stock at expiration and the y-axis represents the profit/loss on the straddle. As the price of the stock increases, the value of the call option increases, while the value of the put option decreases. At the same time, the total profit on the straddle remains constant. Conversely, as the price of the stock decreases, the value of the put option increases, while the value of the call option decreases. Again, the total profit on the straddle remains constant. Thus, at expiration, the straddle will have the same profit regardless of the price of the stock.
