### **The Fama-French 3-Factor Model**

The Fama-French 3-factor model is a model developed by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French in 1992. It is an extension of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and is used to explain the cross-sectional differences in stock returns.

The three factors of the Fama-French model are:

#### **Factor A: Size** 

This factor measures the size of a company, usually measured by its market capitalization. 

$$ Factor\ A = Size = Market\ Capitalization $$

#### **Factor B: Profitability and Investment Patterns**

This factor measures the profitability of a company, usually measured by its book-to-market ratio. 

$$ Factor\ B = Profitability\ and\ Investment\ Patterns = Book-to-Market\ Ratio $$

#### **Factor C: Market** 

This factor measures the market risk, usually measured by the return of the market index. 

$$ Factor\ C = Market = Market\ Index\ Return $$
