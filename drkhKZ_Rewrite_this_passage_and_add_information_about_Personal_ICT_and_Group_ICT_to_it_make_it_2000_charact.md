# Managing an Organisation's ICTs
In order to effectively utilise the potential value generated by an organisation's information infrastructure, it is critical to plan and manage the deployment and integration of its ICTs. To do this, managers must be aware of the different characteristics of the available systems and how they interact with one another. This understanding is essential for designing, organising, and maintaining efficient and effective information infrastructures.

## Personal ICT
Personal ICT is the set of technologies used by an individual for their personal needs and activities. This includes applications such as word processing, spreadsheet software, and email. It also involves hardware such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Personal ICTs enable individuals to work and communicate more effectively and efficiently.

## Group ICT
Group ICT involves the use of technologies that enable groups of people to collaborate and interact with one another. This includes tools such as video conferencing, online collaboration platforms, and chatbots. Group ICTs help organisations to reach out to customers and partners more effectively and coordinate their internal teams more efficiently.

By taking into account the characteristics of both personal and group ICTs, managers can create information infrastructures that are tailored to their organisation's specific needs. This can result in improved communication, coordination, and collaboration between employees, customers, and partners. By leveraging the power of ICTs, organisations can gain a competitive edge in the market and maximise their success.
