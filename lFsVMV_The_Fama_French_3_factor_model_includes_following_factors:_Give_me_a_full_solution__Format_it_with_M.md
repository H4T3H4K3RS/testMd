The Fama-French 3-factor model, developed by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French in 1992, is an extension of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). It is a statistical model that describes stock returns as a function of three factors:

1. Market Factor:
   
   $$ R_i - R_f = \alpha + \beta_i (R_m - R_f) + \epsilon_i$$
   
2. Size Factor:
   
   $$ R_i - R_f = \alpha + \beta_{SMB_i}SMB + \beta_{HML_i}HML + \epsilon_i$$
   
   Where SMB is the average return on small capitalization stocks minus the average return on large capitalization stocks, and HML is the average return on high book-to-market stocks minus the average return on low book-to-market stocks.
   
3. Value Factor:
   
   $$ R_i - R_f = \alpha + \beta_{HML_i}HML + \epsilon_i$$
   
   Where HML is the average return on high book-to-market stocks minus the average return on low book-to-market stocks.

The Fama-French 3-factor model improves upon the CAPM by accounting for the size and value effects that are often observed in stock returns. This model has been widely used for empirical research in finance and has been shown to provide a better fit to the data than the CAPM.
