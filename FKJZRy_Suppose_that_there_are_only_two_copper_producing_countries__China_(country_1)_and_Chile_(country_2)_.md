### Solution

(a) To find the profit-maximizing output levels of both countries, the market output, and the market price we need to solve the following profit maximization problems:

For Country 1:

Max $\Pi_1 = P(Q) * y_1 - TC(y_1)$

subject to $y_1 \geq 0$ 

For Country 2:

Max $\Pi_2 = P(Q) * y_2 - TC(y_2)$

subject to $y_2 \geq 0$ 

The market output and the market price can be found by solving the following equation:

$P(Q) = 30 - (y_1 + y_2)$ 

Solving for $y_1$ and $y_2$ gives us: 

$y_1 = \frac{30 - P(Q)}{2}$ 

$y_2 = \frac{30 - P(Q)}{2}$ 

Substituting the expressions for $y_1$ and $y_2$ into the profit maximization problems for country 1 and country 2 gives us: 

For Country 1:

Max $\Pi_1 = P(Q) * \frac{30 - P(Q)}{2} - 6\frac{30 - P(Q)}{2}$

subject to $\frac{30 - P(Q)}{2} \geq 0$ 

For Country 2:

Max $\Pi_2 = P(Q) * \frac{30 - P(Q)}{2} - 6\frac{30 - P(Q)}{2}$

subject to $\frac{30 - P(Q)}{2} \geq 0$ 

The profit-maximizing output levels and market price can be found by solving the following equation:

$\Pi_1 = \Pi_2$ 

Solving for $P(Q)$ gives us: 

$P(Q) = 15$ 

Substituting the expression for $P(Q)$ into the expressions for $y_1$ and $y_2$ gives us:

$y_1 = \frac{15}{2}$ 

$y_2 = \frac{15}{2}$

The profit-maximizing output levels of both countries, the market output, and the market price are given by: 

$y_1 = \frac{15}{2}$ 

$y_2 = \frac{15}{2}$

$Q = y_1 + y_2 = 15$ 

$P(Q) = 15$ 

This market outcome is called Cournot equilibrium in economic literature.

This market outcome does not result in a market failure since both countries are producing the efficient quantity of copper. Both countries are producing at the socially optimal level, which maximizes the total surplus.
