**A) The market perfect, competitive and does not offer any arbitrage opportunities**

The Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) assumes that the market is not perfect and that arbitrage opportunities exist, though they may be difficult to identify due to market inefficiencies. APT attempts to explain the behavior of asset prices in terms of the underlying macroeconomic factors and the arbitrage opportunities that exist in the market.

Therefore, statement A does not belong to the underlying assumptions of Arbitrage Pricing Theory.
