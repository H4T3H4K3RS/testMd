**Solution**

The profit and loss function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously can be modeled as follows, based on related research papers [1,2]. 

The profit and loss (P&L) is a combination of the inventory and impact costs. 

## Inventory Costs

The inventory cost, $C_{inv}$, is a function of the inventory, $I$, and the mean reversion rate, $r$. It is given by the following equation:

$$C_{inv} = I \cdot r$$

## Impact Costs

The impact costs, $C_{imp}$, are a function of the inventory, $I$, the trading rate, $\lambda$, the impact coefficient, $\gamma$, and the spread, $S_2$. It is given by the following equation:

$$C_{imp} = \lambda \cdot \gamma \cdot I \cdot S_2$$

## Total Profit and Loss

The total profit and loss, $P&L$, is the sum of the inventory and impact costs. It is given by the following equation:

$$P&L = C_{inv} + C_{imp} = I \cdot r + \lambda \cdot \gamma \cdot I \cdot S_2$$
