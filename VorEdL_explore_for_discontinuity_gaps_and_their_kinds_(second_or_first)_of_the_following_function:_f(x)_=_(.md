# **Solution:**

The function $$f(x) = \frac{2|x-1|}{x^2-x^4}$$ has two discontinuity gaps, one of **first type** and one of **second type**.

## **First Type Discontinuity Gap:**

The first type discontinuity gap of the function occurs at $x=1$, since the denominator of the function $x^2-x^4$ becomes 0 when $x=1$.

Therefore, the function is not defined at $x=1$.

## **Second Type Discontinuity Gap:**

The second type discontinuity gap of the function occurs at $x=-1$, since the numerator of the function $2|x-1|$ becomes 0 when $x=-1$.

Therefore, the function is not defined at $x=-1$.
