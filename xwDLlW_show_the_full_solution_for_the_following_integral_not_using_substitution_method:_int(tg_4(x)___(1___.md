**Calculating the integral using the power rule:**

We can solve this integral using the power rule, which states that:

$$\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$$

where $n$ is a real number, and $C$ is an arbitrary constant.

**Applying the power rule to the given integral:**

We can rewrite the given integral to use the power rule by noting that:

$$\frac{d}{dx} (\tan x) = \sec^2 x$$

Substituting this into the given integral, we get:

$$\int \tan^4x \cdot (1 + \tan^2x) \cdot \sec^2x \, dx$$

We can now apply the power rule to this integral, noting that the exponent of $\tan x$ is 4:

$$\int \tan^4x \cdot (1 + \tan^2x) \cdot \sec^2x \, dx = \frac{\tan^5x \cdot (1 + \tan^2x)}{5} + C$$

Therefore, the solution to the given integral is:

$$\int \tan^4x \cdot (1 + \tan^2x) \cdot \sec^2x \, dx = \frac{\tan^5x \cdot (1 + \tan^2x)}{5} + C$$
