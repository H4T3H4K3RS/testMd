## Simulate Function

The given function is used to simulate stock prices over a given period of time and with a certain volatility. The function takes in the following parameters:

* `s` : Initial stock price
* `sigma` : Volatility
* `t` : Total time period
* `steps` : Number of steps in the time period
* `paths` : Number of paths over which to simulate stock prices

The function then returns a matrix of shape `(paths, steps + 1)` containing the simulated stock prices.

The function can be rewritten as follows:

```python
def simulate(s, sigma, t, steps, paths):
    dt = t / steps # Calculate step size
    stock_prices = np.zeros((paths, steps + 1)) # Create empty matrix to store stock prices
    stock_prices[:, 0] = s # Set initial stock price
    for i in range(steps):
        z = np.random.standard_normal(paths) # Generate random numbers
        stock_prices[:, i + 1] = stock_prices[:, i] * np.exp((sigma * np.sqrt(dt) * z) - (0.5 * sigma ** 2 * dt)) # Calculate stock prices for each step
    return stock_prices # Return matrix of simulated stock prices
```

## Calculating Stock Price for Each Step

The stock price at the next step is calculated using the following formula:

$$S_{t+1} = S_t \exp{\left[\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t} z - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\Delta t\right]}$$

Where:

* $S_t$ : Stock price at time $t$
* $\sigma$ : Volatility
* $\Delta t$ : Step size
* $z$ : Random number generated from standard normal distribution
