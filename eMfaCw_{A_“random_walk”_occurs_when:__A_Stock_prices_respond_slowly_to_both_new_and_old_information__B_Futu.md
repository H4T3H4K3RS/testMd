## **Random Walk**
A random walk occurs when future price changes are uncorrelated with past price changes and stock price changes are random but predictable.

The concept of a random walk is used to describe the behavior of stock prices, which respond slowly to both new and old information and past information is not useful in predicting future prices.

### **Mathematical Representation**
The random walk model can be mathematically represented using a stochastic process, where the future values of the process are independent from the past values. 

Let $S_{t}$ be the stock price at time $t$, then the random walk model can be written as:

$$S_{t} = S_{t-1} + \epsilon_{t}$$

where $\epsilon_{t}$ is a random variable with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.

### **Characteristics of a Random Walk**
The characteristics of a random walk include:

- There is no trend or pattern in the stock prices.
- The stock prices are unpredictable.
- The stock prices can be affected by external factors such as news and political events.
- The stock prices are not affected by past information. 
- The stock prices can be affected by the current market conditions.
