**Solution:**

Profit and Loss (PnL) Function for Market Maker Agent:

The profit and loss function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously can be formulated as follows: 

$$PnL = A - B$$

where, 

**A** = Profit from Trade on Market 1 + Profit from Trade on Market 2

**B** = Transaction Fees on Market 1 + Transaction Fees on Market 2

The profits from trades on each market can be formulated as follows:

**Profit from Trade on Market 1**:

$$P_{M1} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_1}(P_{M1,i} \times Q_{M1,i}) - (P_{M1,i} \times Q_{M1,i} - C_{M1,i})$$

where, 

$P_{M1,i}$ = Price of $i^{th}$ trade on Market 1

$Q_{M1,i}$ = Quantity of $i^{th}$ trade on Market 1

$C_{M1,i}$ = Cost incurred for $i^{th}$ trade on Market 1

$N_1$ = Total number of trades on Market 1

**Profit from Trade on Market 2**:

$$P_{M2} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_2}(P_{M2,i} \times Q_{M2,i}) - (P_{M2,i} \times Q_{M2,i} - C_{M2,i})$$

where, 

$P_{M2,i}$ = Price of $i^{th}$ trade on Market 2

$Q_{M2,i}$ = Quantity of $i^{th}$ trade on Market 2

$C_{M2,i}$ = Cost incurred for $i^{th}$ trade on Market 2

$N_2$ = Total number of trades on Market 2
