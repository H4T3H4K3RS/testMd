This is the profit and loss function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously, based on **[1]** and **[2]**.

The profit and loss for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously, $M_1$ and $M_2$, can be given as,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq1}
\text{PL} = \Delta \, P_{M_1} \cdot Q_{M_1} + \Delta \, P_{M_2} \cdot Q_{M_2}
\end{equation}

where,

$\Delta \, P_{M_1}$ is the price difference between the two markets, 

$\Delta \, P_{M_2}$ is the price difference between the two markets,

$Q_{M_1}$ is the quantity traded in $M_1$, and 

$Q_{M_2}$ is the quantity traded in $M_2$.
