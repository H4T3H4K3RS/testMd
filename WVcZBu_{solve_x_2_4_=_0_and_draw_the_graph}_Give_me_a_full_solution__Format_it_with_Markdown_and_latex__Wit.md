# **Solution:**

To solve the equation $x^2 - 4 = 0$, we need to rearrange the equation so that all terms with $x$ are on the left side of the equation and all numbers are on the right side of the equation.

$$x^2 - 4 = 0$$

$$x^2 = 4$$

$$\sqrt{x^2} = \sqrt{4}$$

$$x = \pm \sqrt{4}$$

$$x = \pm 2$$

Therefore, the solution to the equation is $x = \pm 2$.

## **Graph:**

The graph of the equation $x^2 - 4 = 0$ is a parabola that goes through the points $(2, 0)$ and $(-2, 0)$.
