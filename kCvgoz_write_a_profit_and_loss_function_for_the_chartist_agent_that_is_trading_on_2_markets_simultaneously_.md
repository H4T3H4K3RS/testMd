**Solution:**

The profit and loss function for the chartist agent trading on two markets simultaneously can be derived from the following research papers:

1. **"Trading Strategies with Chartist Element: A Study on the Chinese Stock Market"** by Li-Chun Wang, Hsing-Yi Chang, and Chih-Chieh Wen (2008)

2. **"Chartists, Fundamentalists, and Trading in the Foreign Exchange Market"** by Michael W. Brandt (2001)

The profit and loss function for the chartist agent trading in two markets simultaneously can be formulated as follows:

$$P_{2 \ markets} = (\alpha_1 * R_1 + \alpha_2 * R_2) - (B_1 + B_2)$$

Where,

$$R_1$$ = Return on the first market

$$R_2$$ = Return on the second market

$$B_1$$ = Transaction cost on the first market

$$B_2$$ = Transaction cost on the second market

$$\alpha_1$$ = Weightage of the first market

$$\alpha_2$$ = Weightage of the second market
