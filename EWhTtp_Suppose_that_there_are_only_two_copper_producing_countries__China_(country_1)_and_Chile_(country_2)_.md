**Solution**

(a) Find the Nash equilibrium:

Let y1 denote the output of country 1 and y2 denote the output of country 2.

The profit function of country 1 is given by:

$$\pi_1 = P(y_1 + y_2) \cdot y_1 - TC(y_1) = (30 - (y_1 + y_2)) \cdot y_1 - 6y_1 = 24y_1 - 6y_1 - y_1y_2 - 30$$

The profit function of country 2 is given by:

$$\pi_2 = P(y_1 + y_2) \cdot y_2 - TC(y_2) = (30 - (y_1 + y_2)) \cdot y_2 - 6y_2 = 24y_2 - 6y_2 - y_1y_2 - 30$$

The Nash equilibrium is found by solving the following system of equations:

$$\begin{cases} \frac{\partial \pi_1}{\partial y_1} = 24 - 6 - y_2 = 0 \\
\frac{\partial \pi_2}{\partial y_2} = 24 - 6 - y_1 = 0 \end{cases}$$

We get that $y_1 = y_2 = 12$

(b) Calculate the profit-maximizing output levels, market output, and market price:

The profit-maximizing output levels for both countries are $y_1 = y_2 = 12$.

The market output is given by $Y = y_1 + y_2 = 24$.

The market price is given by $P(Y) = 30 - Y = 30 - 24 = 6$.

This market outcome is called the Cournot-Nash equilibrium.

The following graph represents the Cournot-Nash equilibrium:

This market outcome does not result in a market failure since it is the most efficient outcome given the information available to the two countries. Both countries are producing the output that maximizes their own profits, and the market price and output are determined by the interaction of the two countries.
