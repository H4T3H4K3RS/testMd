**Solution:** 

Residual Demands: 
Let P denote the price of copper and Q denote the total quantity of copper traded. Then, the residual demand functions for the two countries are given by:

\begin{align}
R_{1}(P) &= y_{1}(P) \quad \text{where} \quad y_{1}(P) = \frac{Q(P)}{2} \\
R_{2}(P) &= y_{2}(P) \quad \text{where} \quad y_{2}(P) = \frac{Q(P)}{2}
\end{align}

Marginal Revenues: 
The marginal revenue for each country is given by:

\begin{align}
MR_{1}(P) &= \frac{dR_{1}}{dy_{1}}P \\
&= \frac{dR_{1}}{dQ}\frac{dQ}{dy_{1}}P \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\frac{dQ}{dy_{1}}P \\
&= \frac{P}{2}
\end{align}

Similarly, the marginal revenue for country 2 is given by:

\begin{align}
MR_{2}(P) &= \frac{dR_{2}}{dy_{2}}P \\
&= \frac{dR_{2}}{dQ}\frac{dQ}{dy_{2}}P \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\frac{dQ}{dy_{2}}P \\
&= \frac{P}{2}
\end{align}

Reaction Functions:
The reaction functions for each country is determined by the equation: 

\begin{align}
MR_{i}(P) = TC_{i}'(y_{i}) \quad \text{for } \quad i \in \{1,2\}
\end{align}

For country 1, we have:

\begin{align}
MR_{1}(P) &= TC_{1}'(y_{1}) \\
\frac{P}{2} &= 6
\end{align}

Therefore, the reaction function for country 1 is given by:

\begin{align}
y_{1}(P) = \frac{P}{12}
\end{align}

Similarly, for country 2, we have:

\begin{align}
MR_{2}(P) &= TC_{2}'(y_{2}) \\
\frac{P}{2} &= 6
\end{align}

Therefore, the reaction function for country 2 is given by:

\begin{align}
y_{2}(P) = \frac{P}{12}
\end{align}
