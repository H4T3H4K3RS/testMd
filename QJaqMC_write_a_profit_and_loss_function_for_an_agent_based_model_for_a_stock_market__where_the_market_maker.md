## **Profit & Loss Function for Agent-Based Model in Stock Market**

This Profit & Loss (P&L) function is for an Agent-Based Model in the stock market, where the market maker is trading on two markets simultaneously. 

Let $P$ be the price of the stock at time $t=0$ and $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ be the prices at times $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$, respectively. The P&L at a given time $t$ is given by the following equation:

$$P\text{L}_{t} = \left(P_{1} - P\right) + \left(P_{2} - P_{1}\right)$$

where $P\text{L}_{t}$ is the P&L at time $t$.

This equation implies that the P&L at a given time $t$ is equal to the difference in price between the two markets, plus the difference in price between the current market and the initial market (at time $t=0$).
