**Solution**

The probability that the insurance company will be at a loss in a year is calculated as follows:

$$ P(\text{Loss}) = P(\text{Accident}) \cdot P(\text{Loss} | \text{Accident}) $$

where

$P(\text{Accident}) = 0.006$ 

$P(\text{Loss} | \text{Accident}) = \frac{12000}{150 \cdot 1000} = 0.08$

Therefore,

$$ P(\text{Loss}) = 0.006 \cdot 0.08 = 0.00048 $$

Therefore, the probability that the insurance company will be at a loss in a year is 0.00048.
