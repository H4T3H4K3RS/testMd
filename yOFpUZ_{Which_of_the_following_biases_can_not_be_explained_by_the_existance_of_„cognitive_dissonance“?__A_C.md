# **Which of the following biases can not be explained by the existance of „cognitive dissonance“?**

Cognitive dissonance is a psychological phenomenon that occurs when a person holds two or more conflicting beliefs, ideas, or values. It can lead to feelings of unease, discomfort, and confusion. It can also lead to biases such as confirmation bias, the illusion of control bias, and anchoring & adjustment.

## **Confirmation Bias**

Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, and favor information that confirms one's preexisting beliefs. This bias can be explained by the existence of cognitive dissonance, as people are likely to seek out information that confirms their current beliefs in order to reduce the mental discomfort of having conflicting ideas.

## **Illusion of Control Bias**

The illusion of control bias is the tendency to overestimate one's ability to control or influence events. This bias can be explained by cognitive dissonance, as people may overestimate their ability to control events in order to reduce the mental discomfort of having conflicting beliefs.

## **Conservatism**

Conservatism is the tendency to resist change and maintain the status quo. This bias cannot be explained by cognitive dissonance, as cognitive dissonance does not necessarily lead to resistance to change.

## **Anchoring & Adjustment**

Anchoring & adjustment is the tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions. This bias can be explained by cognitive dissonance, as people are likely to rely on the first piece of information they encounter in order to reduce the mental discomfort of having conflicting beliefs.
