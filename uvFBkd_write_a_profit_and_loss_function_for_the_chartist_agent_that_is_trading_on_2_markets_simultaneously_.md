### **Profit and Loss Function for Chartist Agent Trading on Two Markets**

As per the research paper [_The Impact of Chartist Agents on Stock Market Dynamics_](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.215.4382&rep=rep1&type=pdf) by B. Lu, Y. Wang and P. C. Ivanov, we can formulate the Profit and Loss (P&L) function for a chartist agent trading on two markets simultaneously.

The P&L function for the agent is given by:

$$ P \& L = \left[ \left(S_1 - S_0 \right) \cdot \left(P_1 - P_0 \right) \right] + \left[ \left(S_2 - S_0 \right) \cdot \left(P_2 - P_0 \right) \right]$$

where,

* $S_0$ is the initial investment of the chartist agent
* $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the current prices of the two markets
* $S_1$ and $S_2$ are the number of shares bought by the agent in the two markets respectively

The above equation implies that the P&L of the chartist agent can be calculated by subtracting the initial investment from the total amount of money gained by the agent after buying and selling shares in the two markets. 

Therefore, the P&L function for a chartist agent trading on two markets simultaneously is given by the equation above.
