Collusion is an agreement between two or more firms to limit competition, which can lead to higher prices, decreased competition, and lower output. Collusion between firms with identical constant marginal cost will result in an allocation that is not socially desirable because it reduces output and increases prices above the competitive level.

The socially desirable allocation occurs when each firm charges a price equal to its marginal cost and produces at the competitive output level. This results in a socially efficient outcome with the lowest prices and highest output.

Let's consider two firms with identical constant marginal costs, $MC_1 = MC_2 = c$. Assume that the inverse demand for each firm is $P = a - bQ$, where $Q = Q_1 + Q_2$ is the total quantity of output produced.

If the firms collude to maximize their joint profits, they will charge a price of $P = a - b(Q_1 + Q_2)$, and produce a quantity of $Q_1 + Q_2$ that maximizes their joint profits. This is given by

$$Q_1 + Q_2 = \frac{a-c}{2b}$$

The joint profits for the firms are given by

$$\Pi = \left(a - b\left(\frac{a-c}{2b}\right)\right) \left(\frac{a-c}{2b}\right) - c\left(\frac{a-c}{2b}\right)$$

$$\Pi = \frac{(a-c)^2}{4b} - \frac{c(a-c)}{2b}$$

$$\Pi = \frac{(a-c)^2 - 2c(a-c)}{4b}$$

$$\Pi = \frac{(a-c)(a-2c)}{4b}$$

However, this is not a socially desirable outcome, as the price charged is higher than the competitive price of $P = c$ and the quantity produced is lower than the competitive level of $Q = \frac{a-c}{b}$.

Therefore, the statement that two firms with identical constant marginal cost colluding to maximize their joint profits will generate an allocation that is not socially desirable is **false**.
