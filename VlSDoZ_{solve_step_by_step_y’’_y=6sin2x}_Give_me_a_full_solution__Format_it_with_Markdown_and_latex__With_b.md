### **Solution:**

The given differential equation is:

$$y''+y=6\sin 2x$$

The homogeneous part of the equation is:

$$y''+y=0$$

This is a second order differential equation with constant coefficients. We can solve it by using the characteristic equation method.

### **Characteristic Equation:**

The characteristic equation associated with the homogeneous equation is:

$$r^2+1=0$$

Solving for $r$, we get:

$$r = \pm i$$

### **General Solution:**

The general solution of the homogeneous equation is:

$$y_h=c_1\cos x+c_2\sin x$$

### **Particular Solution:**

We can guess a particular solution of the form:

$$y_p=A\sin 2x$$

Substituting it in the given equation, we get:

$$A\sin 2x+A\cos 2x=6\sin 2x$$

Comparing coefficients, we get:

$$A=6$$

So, the particular solution is:

$$y_p=6\sin 2x$$

### **Final Solution:**

The final solution of the given equation is:

$$y=y_h+y_p$$

$$y=c_1\cos x+c_2\sin x+6\sin 2x$$
