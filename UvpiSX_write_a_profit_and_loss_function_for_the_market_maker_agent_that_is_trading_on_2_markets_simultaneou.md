### Model Description

The market maker agent is assumed to have a risk management strategy that is based on the maximum drawdown. The maximum drawdown is the maximum relative loss from peak to valley of the equity curve over a certain period. The maximum drawdown is used to determine the maximum loss the agent can take in a given period.

The agent is also assumed to have a pricing strategy that is based on a pricing function. The pricing function is used to determine the prices of the assets in the two markets simultaneously.

### Profit and Loss Function

The profit and loss (P&L) function for the market maker agent can be expressed as:

$$ P\&L = P_1\left(Q_1\left(t\right) - Q_1\left(t - \Delta t\right)\right) + P_2\left(Q_2\left(t\right) - Q_2\left(t - \Delta t\right)\right) $$

where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the pricing functions for the two markets, $Q_1\left(t\right)$ and $Q_2\left(t\right)$ are the quantities of the assets in the two markets at time $t$, and $\Delta t$ is the time period over which the maximum drawdown is calculated.
