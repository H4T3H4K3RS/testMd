**Answer: False**

A subgame-perfect equilibrium strategy may include a non-credible threat. A non-credible threat is a threat made by a player that they do not intend to follow through with. It is a bluff, a tactic used to try to manipulate the other player into making a decision that favors them.

A subgame-perfect equilibrium strategy is a Nash equilibrium that is calculated for each subgame, or each decision point in the game. It is the optimal strategy for each player, given the other players' strategies. A subgame-perfect equilibrium strategy is not necessarily rational, as it may include non-credible threats.

For example, consider the game of chicken. Player 1 and Player 2 are driving cars towards each other, and each has the option to swerve or continue driving straight. If both players swerve, then the outcome is a tie. However, if one player continues driving straight, then they will win and the other player will lose. 

Player 1 can make a non-credible threat to drive straight. Player 2 cannot be sure whether Player 1 will actually drive straight or swerve, so this threat is non-credible. However, if Player 2 believes that Player 1 will drive straight, then they will swerve. This is a subgame-perfect equilibrium strategy and it includes a non-credible threat.

In conclusion, a subgame-perfect equilibrium strategy may include a non-credible threat, so the statement is false.
