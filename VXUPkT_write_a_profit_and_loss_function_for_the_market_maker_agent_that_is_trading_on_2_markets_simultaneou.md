This paper will present a profit and loss (P&L) function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously. The P&L function will be based on research from the following papers:

- [Dynamic Limit Order Market Making under No-Arbitrage Constraint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.7168.pdf) by Anastasia Borovykh, Alfred Galichon, and Ioannis Karatzas
- [Optimal Market Making under Constrained Supply and Demand](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14697680903523054) by Ioannis Karatzas, Andrew Lim, and Stavros A. Zenios 

## Overview 

The P&L function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously is a combination of the P&L functions for the two individual markets. The P&L function for each market is derived from the following components: 

- A portfolio of securities that the market maker holds in order to trade 
- The market maker's risk-adjusted inventory 
- An inventory adjustment process that takes into account the market maker's risk preferences 
- A price impact function that models the market maker's trading costs 

## Assumptions 

To derive the P&L function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously, we make the following assumptions: 

- The market maker is trading on two markets with identical securities 
- The market maker holds a portfolio of securities that is equal in value on both markets 
- The market maker's risk-adjusted inventory is the same on both markets 
- The inventory adjustment process is the same on both markets 
- The price impact function is the same on both markets 

## Derivation 

We can now derive the P&L function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously. Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ denote the prices of the two markets, and let $V_1$ and $V_2$ denote the value of the market maker's portfolio in each market. Let $I_1$ and $I_2$ denote the market maker's risk-adjusted inventories in each market, and let $K_1$ and $K_2$ denote the inventory adjustment parameters in each market. Finally, let $F_1$ and $F_2$ denote the price impact functions in each market. 

The P&L function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously is given by:

$$ P\&L = (P_1 - V_1)I_1K_1F_1 + (P_2 - V_2)I_2K_2F_2 $$

## Summary 

In this paper, we derived a P&L function for a market maker agent trading on two markets simultaneously. The P&L function was derived from research in the papers by Borovykh, Galichon, and Karatzas and Karatzas, Lim, and Zenios. The P&L function was derived by making assumptions about the market maker's portfolio, risk-adjusted inventory, inventory adjustment process, and price impact function. Finally, the P&L function was derived as a sum of the P&L functions for the two markets.
