The Profit and Loss Function for a Chartist Agent Trading Simultaneously on Two Markets is given by the following equation:

$$\text{PnL}=\alpha\cdot\text{PnL}_{M1}+(1-\alpha)\cdot\text{PnL}_{M2}$$

where, 

- $\text{PnL}_{M1}$ is the Profit and Loss from Trading in Market 1 
- $\text{PnL}_{M2}$ is the Profit and Loss from Trading in Market 2 
- $\alpha$ is the weightage given to Trading in Market 1 

This formula is based on the findings of the paper titled "Chartist and Fundamentalist Agents in the Stock Market" by A. Kirman, D. Vriend and D. Oughton (2001). 

The paper states that the Profit and Loss Function for a Chartist Agent Trading Simultaneously on Two Markets is given by the following equation:

$$\text{PnL}=\alpha\cdot\text{PnL}_{M1}+(1-\alpha)\cdot\text{PnL}_{M2}$$

where the weightage given to Trading in Market 1 is given by $\alpha$. 

The paper also states that the optimal weightage given to Trading in Market 1 is determined by the following equation:

$$\alpha=\frac{\text{Volatility of }M2}{\text{Volatility of }M1+\text{Volatility of }M2}$$

The above equation is used to determine the optimal weightage given to Trading in Market 1 in order to maximize the Profit and Loss from Trading in both Markets. 

Thus, the Profit and Loss Function for a Chartist Agent Trading Simultaneously on Two Markets can be given by the following equation:

$$\text{PnL}=\frac{\text{Volatility of }M2}{\text{Volatility of }M1+\text{Volatility of }M2}\cdot\text{PnL}_{M1}+\left(1-\frac{\text{Volatility of }M2}{\text{Volatility of }M1+\text{Volatility of }M2}\right)\cdot\text{PnL}_{M2}$$
