Prospect Theory is a behavioral economic theory proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. It is based on the observation that people tend to make decisions that are not necessarily rational, but rather based on emotions and situational context. The theory assumes that investors are loss-averse, meaning they are more sensitive to losses than gains. This means that investors will make riskier decisions when they feel they have little to lose.

The theory states that investors are motivated by expected utility rather than expected value. This means that the utility of an investment is based on the level of wealth and not the probability of outcomes.

In addition, the theory assumes that investors are risk averse, meaning they prefer to avoid risk in their investments. This means that they will typically choose investments with a lower expected return but lower risk.

The theory also assumes that investors are overoptimistic, meaning they believe their investments will have higher returns than they actually will. This can lead to overconfidence, which can lead to poor decision-making.

Finally, the theory assumes that investors are biased towards taking action and making decisions. This can lead to impulsive decision-making and a lack of long-term planning.

In summary, Prospect Theory assumes that investors are loss-averse, motivated by expected utility, risk-averse, overoptimistic, and biased towards taking action. These assumptions can lead to poor decision-making if not taken into account.
